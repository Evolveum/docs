          MidPoint provides essential management capabilities of roles and responsibilities by using its advanced role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms.
      details: >
          Roles can be defined in midPoint, including all necessary privileges, role hierarchies, policies and descriptive data, especially for security personnel (e.g. security manager).
          Role governance can be managed in midPoint, recording business owners, custodians and approvers responsible for day-to-day operation.
          Such governance approach can be applied to roles, application catalog and other aspects of midPoint, getting governance closer to assets.
          Organizational structure can be used to assign collective responsibilities, e.g. common responsibilities and privileges of security teams.
          Escalation capability can be used to maintain accountability of upper management, making sure that the delegated responsibilities are conducted in a timely manner.
          Simulation capability can be used to predict effects of role model changes.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint is necessary for consistent application of security roles and responsibilities.
          Security personnel often have elevated privileges.
          MidPoint can make sure the privileges are properly recorded, that they are automatically revoked when needed, that the privileges are regularly re-certified.
          While, in theory, this can be done manually, it is not practical and there may be issues in consistent management of privileges and their timely revocation.

              The control suggests establishment of user access roles based on business requirements, also known as business roles.
              Role wizard, together with delegated administration capabilities, can be essential tools to delegate definition of business roles to the business users.
              This is yet another place in the standard that suggests use of RBAC.
          - >
              Control description describes access rights cloning (a.k.a. "assign rights as Mr. Smiths has") as an undesirable practice, recommending use of RBAC instead.
# Example: (with 5.15) Access request, approval of application owner, approval of role owner, approval of manager
# Example: (with 5.15) delegate creation of business roles, using role wizard
# Example: Certification campaigns. Maybe considering classification (privileged access rights certified more often).
# Example: inducement of access rights in orgstruct
# Example: micro-certification when org membership changes
# Example: manual deactivation of users, after high-risk termination of employment

          Supplier identities can be managed by midPoint, including their access rights and relation to supplier organizations.
      details: >
          Supplier identities, such as contractors or support engineers can be recorded in midPoint, using specific archetypes, applying specific policies (inducements in the archetypes, policy rules).
          MidPoint records all access granted to the supplier, allowing assessment of risk posed by individual supplier identities.
          Organizational structure can be used to group such external identities with respect to their mother companies, making sure all supplier identities and access rights are properly de-provisioned when contract with specific supplier is terminated.
          Classification can be used to limit supplier's access to classified information based on hard policy, e.g. prohibiting supplier identity to gain any role which gives access to systems classified as "sensitive".
          Application inventory can be used to catalog third-party (cloud) services used by the organization, including all entities that have access to them.
          Classifications can be used to categorize cloud services, according to provided level of security and sensitivity of information stored there.
          Notifications can be used to communicate security policies and rules for acceptable use of information to suppliers, when gaining access to systems.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint can manage access rights of suppliers, e.g., by creating temporary access rights automatically revoked on expired date,
          by creating a business role especially created for a specific supplier that can be easily monitored (who has access to that role) and revoked.
      notes:
          - >
              Personal information protection should be considered when working with supplier, especially if cross-border transfer is involved,
              even more importantly in case of information transfer outside EU (see GDPR).
              MidPoint can provide an advantage in case that all personal information transfer is mediated by midPoint, as midPoint maintains record of information transfer,
              and it can also make sure that information erasure is properly initiated.

          Most of the measures described in control 5.19 can be used to implement the contractual clauses of this control.
          MidPoint can make sure that access is granted to supplier identities only after all necessary contracts are in place (using clearance mechanism),
          e.g. only allowing access to users that have signed personal non-disclosure agreements.
          Audit trail and object history features can provide valuable information during management of incidents involving supplier identities and actions.

          MidPoint is an essential tool for containing security incidents, allowing immediate deactivation of user access to applications.
          MidPoint can help with evidence collection, especially by providing information on user access rights and records from its audit trail.
          MidPoint can be a useful tool in escalation phase as well, quickly providing temporary access to ensure business continuity.
          All escalation activities performed by midPoint are properly recorded in midPoint audit trail.
          In case that escalation activities are performed outside of midPoint control, midPoint can be used ex-post to clean up the escalation fallout, discovering temporary accounts and privilege escalation.
          Synchronization capabilities can be used for that purpose.
          Automated identity connectors based on ConnId framework ensure a quick response in the containment phase, as well as rapid escalation and reliable post-incident cleanup.
