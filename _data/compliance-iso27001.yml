          MidPoint is designed to manage authentication information, especially passwords.
      details: >
          MidPoint is built to distribute authentication information to target systems, making sure that the passwords are strong and up-to-date.
          MidPoint self-service user interface can be used to manage authentication information by users, including interactive indication of password strength.
          Password complexity and lifetime policies can be specified, enforced and they can also be used to generate strong passwords.
          MidPoint can be used to quickly change password or deactivate accounts on all connected systems, in an event of password compromise.
          Events related to change of authentication information are recorded in audit trail.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint can improve authentication level in a company by centrally enforcing password policy thanks to its password management.
      notes:
          - >
              This control is mostly about password management, it does not deal much with non-password authentication or credentials.
              ISO/IEC 24760 is referenced for that.
          - >
              MidPoint relies on cooperation of an access management (AM/SSO) system to implement most of the authentication and enforcement capabilities.
              MidPoint can manage authentication information, such as passwords or passkeys.
              However, midPoint cannot efficiently deal with authentication itself, or aspect of credential management related to authentication, such as forcing password change on next log-in.
              This functionality has to be implemented in close cooperation with the authentication system.
          - >
              Management of initial passwords and self-service password resets do not have any ideal solution.
              There are numerous trade-offs and compromises to be made.
              The solution has to be custom made for every organization or environment.

  implementation:
      overview: >
          MidPoint is an essential component to make sure access to information is provisioned, reviewed, modified and removed in accordance with policies.
      details: >
          Access request and approval process can be used to request access, subject the request to appropriate approvals, and automatically provision the access.
          The process makes sure that all relevant approvals are processes before access is granted, dynamically evaluating approval schemes based on individual role definitions.
          Temporal activation constraints ("from" and "to" timestamps) can be used to limit validity of the identity, as well as assignment of access rights to the identity.
          Certification capability can be used to review access rights at regular intervals.
          Moreover, midPoint automatically removes on inactivates access rights of entities who have left the organization.
          Application owners recorded in application inventory can be used as part of the access rights management, taking part in approval and review (certification) processes.
          MidPoint automatically evaluates all applicable policy rules, making sure that segregation of duties (SoD) and information classification rules are maintained.
          MidPoint naturally maintains a central record of all assigned access rights, including assignment meta-data: when was access requested, who has approved access, etc.
          Access rights can be automatically assigned and unassigned according to organizational structure membership, either by using inducement, or by using role autoassignment capability.
          Automatic review of access rights at the moment of organizational membership change can be implemented by micro-certification feature.
          All access right changes are recorded in the audit trail.
      rationale: >
          The main functionality of midPoint is focusing on the access control and access rights.
          This is a very important domain for midPoint.
          Without using midPoint, it may be hard for organizations to be compliant with this control.
          MidPoint can be the “one tool” needed to correctly manage access rights from one place.
      notes:
          - >
              The control asks for consideration of reason of employment termination (among other aspects) for access rights de-provisioning.
              MidPoint is built to de-provision access rights immediately when it learns about employment change.
              However, HR data sources are often integrated using reconciliation, which may have significant time delays.
              Therefore, it should be considered to supplement reconciliation with live synchronization for the HR system.
              Alternatively, manual deactivation process should be established for users where the circumstances of termination of employment suggest elevated risk.
          - >
              The control suggests establishment of user access roles based on business requirements, also known as business roles.
              Role wizard, together with delegated administration capabilities, can be essential tools to delegate definition of business roles to the business users.
              This is yet another place in the standard that suggests use of RBAC.

          Supplier identities, such as contractors or support engineers can be recorded in midPoint, using specific archetypes, applying specific policies (inducements in the archetypes, policy rules).
          MidPoint records all access granted to the supplier, allowing assessment of risk posed by individual supplier identities.
          Organizational structure can be used to group such external identities with respect to their mother companies, making sure all supplier identities and access rights are properly de-provisioned when contract with specific supplier is terminated.
          Classification can be used to limit supplier's access to classified information based on hard policy, e.g. prohibiting supplier identity to gain any role which gives access to systems classified as "sensitive".
          Application inventory can be used to catalog third-party (cloud) services used by the organization, including all entities that have access to them.
          Classifications can be used to categorize cloud services, according to provided level of security and sensitivity of information stored there.
          Notifications can be used to communicate security policies and rules for acceptable use of information to suppliers, when gaining access to systems.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint can manage access rights of suppliers, e.g., by creating temporary access rights automatically revoked on expired date,
          by creating a business role especially created for a specific supplier that can be easily monitored (who has access to that role) and revoked.
      notes:

              Personal information protection should be considered when working with supplier, especially if cross-border transfer is involved,
              even more importantly in case of information transfer outside EU (see GDPR).
              MidPoint can provide an advantage in case that all personal information transfer is mediated by midPoint, as midPoint maintains record of information transfer,
              and it can also make sure that information erasure is properly initiated.

          MidPoint is designed to work with systems (identity resources) that are not constantly available.
          Operations are re-tried, resource can be explicitly configured for maintenance mode, synchronization capability can be used to restore data consistency.
          Provisioning consistency capability of midPoint automatically corrects all inconsistencies it discovers, which can be used to gradually recover from disruption.
          Auto-scaling capability can provide resilience to unexpected load peaks.
          Should there be a need to create a replacement system during disruption,
          midPoint RBAC mechanisms together with efficient provisioning engine can be used to quickly and automatically grant access to the replacement system,
          maintaining appropriate access levels for individual users.
          E.g. midPoint can quickly provision access to a new application in case that an existing cloud application is disrupted.
          MidPoint identity repository contains copies of identity data, which can be used to quickly restore the data to any application.
          Policy-driven RBAC mechanism can be used to activate pre-configure emergency access control during disruption, providing controlled and panic-free elevation of privileges for incident responders.

              Unavailability of MidPoint does not mean unavailability of identity and access management capabilities.
              MidPoint is designed to provision changes to identity resources, allowing resources to operate independently.
              Unavailability of midPoint means limitation of identity management capabilities, however it does not usually limit operational capabilities of applications.

          MidPoint documentation has a special compliance section, which provides overview and guidance for compliance with several compliance frameworks.
          Integral documentation of midPoint (a.k.a. midScribe) can be used to maintain deployment documentation together with the configuration,
          with an ability to automatically generate comprehensive deployment documentation.
          This approach is ideal for documentation of fulfillment of specific compliance requirements, together with the technical means used to implement them.
          The documentation can be easily kept up to date, and the configuration can easily be reviewed when compliance requirements change.
          Certification mechanisms can be used to regularly review applicability of policies (e.g. roles) to satisfy compliance requirements.
          Certification can also be used to automatically review assignment of information classifications (labeling) and clearances.
          Access certification is also useful for regular review of security-related roles and responsibilities.
          Organizational structure and location hierarchies can be used to apply variations of policies to specific organizational units or locations, reflecting specifics of local legislation and regulations.
          Policy rules can be used to limit transfer of information (e.g. personal data) to regions limited by regulations, or regions that do not provide appropriate protection for information.
          Risk management capabilities (planned) could be used to identify risk hot-spots, prioritizing them for risk treatment and improvements of related policies.

      overview: >
          MidPoint has several mechanisms to ensure long-term retention of essential information.
      details: >
          MidPoint can apply lifecycle models to all object types, including identities, policy and configuration objects.
          There is a built-in "archived" lifecycle state, which is supposed to mark objects stored for record-keeping purposes.
          Objects can be kept around in archived state as long as the legislation requires, e.g. as required by regulations regarding retention of employee data.
          Archived objects can be used to avoid re-use of identifiers, avoiding inconsistencies in long-term record-keeping.
          MidPoint records all activities in audit trail, which can be further processed and archived as permanent record.
          Data structure of the audit trail is publicly documented, using data formats that are very likely to remain readable in the future.
          MidPoint object language assists in long-term storage of objects, as the language is text-based (XML,JSON,YAML), clearly defined by schema and version controlled.
          Objects stored in midPoint object language are guaranteed to be readable and machine-processable in the foreseeable future.
          Authorizations can be used to limit access to information stored in midPoint repository, making sure that records have appropriate level of protection.
          E.g. special access control rules can be applied to archived data objects.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint provides supporting functionality for archival and long-term retention of identity-related data.
      notes:
          - >
              While audit trail provides detailed record of all activities, it is also quite demanding to store full audit trail for a long time.
              Retention of audit log data may be limited by other factors too, such as privacy regulations.
              Therefore, audit trails are frequently kept only for a limited time periods.
              However, midPoint meta-data can be used as a partial supplement for audit trail data, as the metadata record important moments of data lifetime.
              Metadata can be maintained for a very long period of time, providing essential record-keeping information even if detailed audit trail data are lost.
          - >
              Information classification should be considered for retention of records.
              Application inventory, and especially the classification of applications can provide baseline data for setting up retention of information in individual systems.
              E.g. setting up policies to report inactive accounts in systems with respect to their classification, or setting up certification policies with am iam to remove unnecessary accounts.

      ISO27002 guidance for this control is surprisingly brief, given the scope, depth and impact of privacy to cybersecurity field.
      The guidance refers to other ISO documents, and especially to relevant legislation and regulations.
      General data protection regulation (GDPR) enacted by European Union is a prime example of such legislation.
      It sets requirements, expectations and best practices that are worth following even in international context.
  implementation:
      overview: >
          MidPoint provides features that are necessary for maintaining privacy at scale, especially when dealing with consumer identities, external collaborators and similar broad user communities.
      details: >
          MidPoint is built specifically to work with personal data, keep the data consistent, control transfer of personal data and enforce policies.
          As such, it has absolutely crucial role in establishing and maintaining of privacy practices in organizations, especially if the privacy is to be applied consistently at scale.
          The core of the functionality is formed around common identity model (common schema) that midPoint brings for identities.
          Common identity model gives meaning to all the identity data, allowing establishment of policies on their appropriate use.
          For example we know which attributes contain personally identifiable information (PII), therefore we can control its distribution and use.
          This is further refined by identity lifecycle mechanism, controlling use and storage of data at certain states of identity lifecycle.
          For example, data regarding archived identities can be automatically reduced to the necessary minimum (information erasure).
          Projection links are used in midPoint to track copies of information, which is essential for keeping records about copies of personal data.
          The links are efficiently creating information inventory for personal data.
          Provisioning mechanism can be used to set up appropriate extent of personal data to target systems.
          Even more importantly, it can also be used to delete (deprovision) the data when not needed.
          Provisioning, together with synchronization mechanisms are essential for keeping all copies of personal data up-to-date, which is a common requirement of privacy regulations.
          Assignments can be used to track application of legal bases for information processing, represented by roles and services (applications).
          Assignment can also be used as a reflection of user consent, making sure that all information provisioned at the time consent was given is properly deprovisioned when consent is revoked.
          Integral documentation (midScribe) can be used to document the legal bases for information processing as they are associated with roles and services.
          This is especially useful for documenting business roles and archetypes, as they usually convey information about legal bases (e.g. employee archetype as representation of employment contract as a legal basis).
          Object metadata can be used to record origin of objects, documenting legal provenance of processed information.
          This can be further extended by value metadata, which document provenance of every individual data item and value.
          Use of location information and classifications, together with policy rules, can be used to avoid illegal transfer of personal information, e.g. making sure that personal information is copied only to applications located in European Union.
          Authorizations can be used to limit access to personal information within midPoint, controlling access at very fine level.
          Audit trail is used to record all activities regarding use and copies of personal information within the reach of midPoint deployment.
      rationale: >
          While privacy and personal data can be managed manually in smaller organizations, midPoint is absolutely essential for large organizations.
          The minute details of personal data management cannot be easily tracked and managed when number of identities, identity types, roles and policies grows.
          Automation and policy-based approach is the only feasible option.
      notes:
          - >
              Retention of audit log data may be limited by privacy regulations.
          - >
              Very common misconception is that privacy is all about secrecy of personally identifiable information (PII).
              This belief is wrong in all of its aspects.
              Firstly, privacy is not just about secrecy of information.
              Privacy is primarily concerned about appropriate use of information.
              The sole fact that an organization legally posses personal data does not entitle the organization to unlimited processing of the data.
              Secondly, privacy is not just about personally identifiable information, such as national identifiers.
              Privacy is concerned with much broader concept of personal data, which includes information that may not be necessarily identifiable, such as information about gender or medical condition of subjects.
              Overall, understanding the nature of privacy is much more complex than it may seem.
              Consultation with a privacy professional is more than recommended.

          MidPoint clearances (part of information classification features) can be used to represent results of additional personnel screening.
          Policy rules can be used to enforce polices with respect to screening, e.g. enforcing that only users that have passed the screening can get access to applications containing sensitive information.
          Role-based access control structures can be set up to require screening for certain roles or jobs, especially for security-related tasks.
          Certification campaign can be used to repeat or update screening as necessary.
          Micro-certifications can be used to initiate ad-hoc screening when a person is reassigned in organizational structure or acquires a role with elevated privileges.

          Certification campaigns can be used to update the trainings, listing people that need to be re-training and track progress of re-training.
          Micro-certifications can be used to initiate ad-hoc re-training when a person is reassigned in organizational structure or acquires a role with elevated privileges.
          Provisioning capabilities can be combined with role-based access control to set up special-purpose e-mail distribution lists to manage security awareness.
          For example, a special-purpose e-mail distribution list can be set up for all personnel related to cybersecurity.
          All business roles that relate to cybersecurity may induce membership in the list, thus the list is automatically managed.
          Such list can be used to spread awareness about updated policies, potential vulnerabilities, training opportunities, suggestions of best practice, infographics and so on.
          Information distributed using automatically-managed lists is can be targeted, adapted to a specific audience and hence much more effective.
          Similar lists can be automatically set up for all users dealing with sensitive information (using information classifications), all personnel dealing with personal data and so on.

          The assignment stays in place, therefore the access can be easily restored for the user when the disciplinary action is over.
          Moreover, the activation mechanism allow to set up revocation of access rights for a specific period, after which access rights are automatically restored.

          Identity lifecycle and policy-driven role-based access control (PD-RBAC) mechanism are instrumental in handling privileges in termination/change situations.
      details: >
          Identity lifecycle can naturally handle termination of employment.
          MidPoint is using synchronization mechanisms to pull data from the human resource (HR) systems, including data about termination and change of employment.
          Such HR data are reflected to identity lifecycle, usually setting users with terminated employment to archived lifecycle state.
          This lifecycle state can be used to deactivate any access that user had, it can be used to minimize the data or handle the situation in other ways.
          Assignments can be retained in archived lifecycle state, indicating roles, organizational membership and responsibilities that the user had at the termination of employment.
          This can be an advantage for clearances that indicate responsibilities and obligations that remain valid after termination of employment, such as non-disclosure agreements (NDA).
          Policy-driven role-based access control (PD-RBAC) is designed to automatically react to change of employment.
          The preferred method to grant privileges based on organizational structure is to use inducement mechanism in organizational units.
          Privileges granted using such mechanisms are automatically recomputed when employment changes, as indicated by change in organizational structure synchronized from the HR system.
          Alternatively, role auto-assignment rules can be used to automatically adjust privileges when employment and responsibilities of user changes.
          Micro-certification can be used as an supplementary mechanisms, especially in case that most privileges are assigned using access request process.
          Micro-certification can be automatically triggered when user's organizational assignment changes, motivating reduction of privileges.
          Policy rules can be used together with reporting capabilities to detect vacant roles and responsibilities, e.i. responsibilities that need to re-assigned after termination or change of employment of their (former) assignees.
          Delegated administration can enable suppliers and partner to manage identities representing their organizations, e.g. de-activating access after termination of employment.
          Audit trail and object history capabilities can be used to examine privileges that a user had before termination or change of employment, e.g. to improve current policies and automation schemes.

          MidPoint obviously cannot influence contractual obligations after termination of employment or contract.
          It can keep user record for some time, even record some of the obligations.
          However, the primary strength of midPoint is handling situations after "change of employment", which usually means re-assignment of users in organizational structure.
          Many mechanisms of midPoint can be used in this situation.
      notes:
          - >
              The control suggests that changes in responsibility should be managed as termination of old responsibility and initiation of new responsibility.
              We like to interpret that in quite a loose way, not requiring literal termination of accounts or removal of privileges that are necessary for new responsibility.
              MidPoint is designed to remove accounts and privileges that are not needed for new responsibility, keeping the necessary ones.

          Role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism together with provisioning can be used to set up all necessary privileges and security configuration for remote access.
          This includes configuration of network access through firewalls, virtual private networks (VPNs), authentication configuration, policies and so on.
          RBAC, provisioning and identity lifecycle can make sure that the access is properly disabled (de-provisioned) when remote access is no longer needed or employment is terminated, making sure that the network access will not be left open.
          Provisioning configuration and policy rules can be used to make sure that the users with remote access have appropriate configuration to use multi-factor authentication.
          Reporting capability can be used to find users that have remote access, yet they do not have appropriate credentials for second factor enrolled yet.
          Information classification together with policy rules can make sure that users with remote access do not have access to systems containing highly-sensitive information, if such policy is necessary.

          In such case, midPoint can manage access tokens and their properties, controlling physical access privileges of persons using policies and automation.
          MidPoint can use location information to automatically grant basic access to physical location.
          Even more importantly, midPoint can automatically revoke all physical access to location when a person is re-assigned to a different location.
          MidPoint can use identity lifecycle mechanism to automatically revoke all physical access when employment is terminated, based on data synchronized from the human resource (HR) system.
          Role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism can be used to automatically grant and revoke physical access based on job roles and responsibility.
          E.g. midPoint can automatically grant physical access to call center rooms for all call center agents, automatically revoking the access when person is re-assigned to a different job.
          Policy rules can be used to limit access to certain areas only to specific roles or organizational units.
          E.g. access to information processing facilities (data centers, server rooms) can be limited only for IT staff, refusing to grant such access for any non-IT personel.
          Access certification mechanism can be used for re-certification of physical access (e.g. access to security perimeters).
          MidPoint delegated administration can be used to register visitors and automatically grant them physical access appropriate for the location.
          Alternatively, self-registration can be used by visitors to pre-register for access.
          Activation schema can be used to grant access to visitors on a temporary basis, automatically disabling all granted access after a specified time period.

      overview: >
          MidPoint has numerous features to support management of privileged access rights.
      details: >
          Privileged access rights can be represented as entitlements in midPoint, their assignment to users is recorded, tracked and synchronized from identity resources.
          Given sufficient coverage by identity connectors, midPoint can have comprehensive record of privileged access rights assignments across the organization.
          Role-based access control (RBAC) is primary mechanism for organization and automation of privileged access rights management.
          RBAC can be used to assign privileged access rights to appropriate roles or business responsibilities, automating assignment of privileges to users.
          Even more importantly, RBAC automates unassignment of privileged access rights, automatically removing unnecessary privileges.
          Furthermore, policy-based RBAC is extending the access control with dynamic rules, which further organizes and automates management of privileged access rights.
          Role-based mechanisms and policies can be used to make sure that the "minimum requirement" criterion of this control can be satisfied.
          Privileged access rights determined by the policies can be automatically provisioned to user accounts, and automatically de-provisioned (revoked) as needed.
          Assignment of privileged access rights to the users are recorded in midPoint, including the meta-data, which satisfies the recording requirement of this control ("record of all privileges allocated").
          Role mining capabilities can be used to find patterns in usage of privileges, creating appropriate business roles.
          This approach increases the degree of automation and reliability of privileged access rights management.
          Privileges access rights that cannot fit into business roles can be managed by access request process, subject to appropriate approval.
          Policy rules can be used to make sure requests for privileged access are subject to additional approval step, and cannot be assigned without explicit approval, which satisfies requirement of this control for "maintaining an authorization process".
          MidPoint provides ability to assign privileged access rights temporarily, using activation schema in the assignment.
          Access certification campaigns can be used to regularly review and certify assignment of privileged access rights.
          Micro-certifications can be used to momentarily review privileged access rights of a user when an important change or event occurs, such re-assignment of the user in organizational structure.
          Mechanisms of information classification and clearances can be used to make sure user has appropriate competence for use of privileged access rights.
          Personas can be used to create separate identities for users that accumulate significant amount of privileged access rights, such as system administrators.
          Such users can have special personas with privileged access rights, separated from their common user personas.
          Such privileged personas may be subject to stricter security requirements, such as requirement for stronger password or multi-factor authentication.
          Special accounts in identity resources can be marked as "protected", avoiding any unintended modification, linking or other abuse of the accounts.
          This mechanism can be used to protect emergency and hardwired accounts such as "root" or "administrator", avoiding unintended use of such accounts.
          Capabilities for management of non-human identities (NHI) can be used to manage application accounts, accounts that represent devices and other technical accounts.
          Such accounts can be managed with the same mechanisms as user accounts, using roles, policies and approval processes as necessary.
          Reporting and dashboarding capabilities can be used to list all privileged access and apply analytics for better understanding and improvements of privileged access structure.
          Audit trail provides complete record of changes in privileged access right assignments.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint provides numerous features to properly manage privileged access rights at scale.
          Management of privileged access rights in medium-to-large organizations without such features is very unrealistic.
          Manual management of privileged access rights at such scale is certain to require huge effort, while being slow to react and very unreliable.
          Strong identity administration and governance (IGA) platform such as midPoint is absolutely necessary to satisfy this control in larger organizations.
      notes:
          - >
              MidPoint fully supports and encourages assignments of privileged assignments to personalized accounts of the users, avoiding use of shared accounts and accounts with generic user identifiers (such as "root" or "administrator").
              MidPoint supports indirect approaches, such as the "sudo" mechanism, or "Domain Admins" group.
              Roles and entitlements in midPoint are designed to assign privileged access rights to user accounts, recording them, managing them and revoking them as necessary.

          MidPoint is an essential tool for managing information access restriction, supporting it with numerous features.
      details: >
          MidPoint is designed to manage access control rules and policies, restricting access to information by particular user or group.
          MidPoint entitlements represent permissions, restricting access to information in applications and databases.
          Entitlements are applied to user accounts by provisioning mechanism.
          Synchronization mechanism keeps entitlements consistent with access control policies.
          User records and assignments stored in midPoint identity repository record access rights assigned to particular users.
          Activation schema can be used in assignments to grant temporary permissions.
          Organization units (representing groups, divisions, teams, projects, etc.) and roles (representing jobs and business responsibilities) are used to group users, applying policies consistently across the organization using roles-based access control (RBAC) principles.
          Entitlements are derived from RBAC mechanisms, considering additional dynamic policies, applying the entitlement to user accounts using provisioning mechanisms.
          Fine-grained access control policies can be applied to various objects, such as file shares, data partitions and spaces and documents.
          Relevant data objects can be synchronized to midPoint, usually in a form of "services" with an appropriate archetype.
          Mechanism of parametric roles can be used to control access to such objects, using relation parameter to specify access level (e.g. read, write, administration).
          Information classification mechanisms can be used to set high-level access policies for class of applications, e.g. allowing public and anonymous access only to applications processing public data.
          This provides partial isolation of sensitive applications, ensuring that only users with appropriate clearances get access to sensitive information.
          Audit trail records all changes in access control permissions.
          This information can be used for reference, investigation or analysis.
      rationale: >
          Management of information access restrictions is an extremely demanding task, especially when it needs to be done on scale.
          It requires establishing of access control policies, and consistent enforcement of the policies across many applications and identity resources.
          Identity administration and governance (IGA) platform such as midPoint is necessary to satisfy this control in any medium-to-large organization.
      notes:
          - >
              MidPoint relies on access control enforcement in applications and identity resource.
              Applications are policy decisions points (PDP) and, more importantly, policy enforcement points (PEP).
              MidPoint is managing and distributing the policies, being a policy administration point (PAP).
          - >
              This control requires "configuration mechanisms to control access", which effectively prohibits hard-coded access control rules in the application.
              Applications have to expose entitlements, which can be assigned to accounts.
              MidPoint is designed to manage such entitlement assignments using its role-based mechanisms and policies.
          - >
              The control describes advantages of "dynamic access management" mechanism in length.
              However, it is not clear how is such a mechanism supposed to work.
              Probably the closest implementation could be a variation of digital rights management (DRM) mechanism, which is notoriously difficult to use, a mechanism with questionable reliability.
              We recommend not to follow the guidance for "dynamic access management", and rather rely on reliable application of proven and established access control techniques.

      overview: >
          MidPoint can manage access control setting of source code management systems, CI/CD and testing platforms and other software development systems.
      details: >
          Strong provisioning capabilities of midPoint, together with appropriate ConnId connectors, can be used to manage access control in numerous software development systems and platforms.
          MidPoint can control access of individual developers to specific source code repositories in source code management systems, pipelines in continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) platforms, testing environments and all other systems related to software development.
          Access to the software development tooling can be controlled in an automated way, using policy-driven role-based access control (PD-RBAC).
          Developers can gain access to individual repositories, pipelines and environments based on their membership in teams or projects, their access level (read/write) determined by their position or role in the project.
          Fine-grained access control for setting up access levels can be implemented using relation parameter, together with parametric inducements in archetypes corresponding to source code repositories.
          Access that is automatically granted using PD-RBAC mechanism is automatically adjusted or revoked when the membership, position or role of the developer changes.
          Access to source code repositories can be seamlessly integrated with project management, automatically creating source code repositories and granting permissions for project members, revoking permissions when members leave the project.
          Similarly, access to source code can be managed for suppliers, contractors and consultants, granting access as they join a project and revoking it when they leave.
          Automation provided by PD-RBAC mechanisms makes sure that the access will be reliably revoked, keeping risks manageable.
          When needed, special-purpose personas can be created for "testing identities", identities of quality assurance engineers that group testing accounts (as opposed to their ordinary user accounts).
          MidPoint audit trail records all changes in permissions, including source code access right changes.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint is necessary to manage access control to source code and other software development tools and platforms at scale.
          While access to a small set of source code repositories can be managed manually, manual management becomes infeasible as the organization grows.
          Large number of organizational units, team, activities and projects present various needs for source code management and permissions.
          Excessive access rights for source code repositories may remain unnoticed for years, yet they pose a serious security risk.
          Management of source code repository access has to be automated - especially revocation of access rights.
          This problem is especially emphasized in large software development companies or IT consultancies that conduct large number of projects, many of them are relatively short-lived.
          Frequent change of staff assignments, moving people between projects, engagement of suppliers/contractor/consultants and similar dynamic business behavior requires strong identity governance platform to operate in a secure manner.
      notes:
          - >
              Process known as "pull request", described as "authorization procedure" by the control, is implemented by source code management platforms.
              MidPoint does not take part in this process directly.
              However midPoint can control permissions to allow certain team members to review and merge pull requests, "authorizing" source code changes.
          - >
              MidPoint can be especially helpful for controlling access to testing environments, especially of there are copies of production data.
              Testing environments are notorious for lax management of assess rights and poor cleanup of access permissions after test.
              MidPoint can manage access permissions of quality assurance staff and scan the systems for testing accounts that are not accounted for.

      details: >
          MidPoint is instrumental in setting up flexible, identity-based authentication policies, such as requiring all users with privileged access to use multi-factor authentication.
          MidPoint does that in close cooperation with single sign-on (SSO) and access management (AM) systems, using identity connectors, provisioning and synchronization mechanisms to manage the SSO/AM policies.
          Authentication policy rules can be based on user roles (RBAC) or information classification schemes, as suggested by the control description.
          Reporting capabilities and dashboards can be used to analyze authentication policies applied to users and to identify violations or possible improvements.
          Moreover, midPoint has a built-in flexible authentication mechanism, allowing various configuration of authentication mechanisms when users log into midPoint user interface.
          There is a possibility to configure flexible authentication flows, including multi-factor authentication.
      rationale: >
          Vast majority of authentication requirements are handled by single sign-on (SSO) and access management (AM) systems, acting as authentication servers.
          MidPoint does not deal with most authentication aspects directly.
          However, midPoint is essential in setting up, maintaining and reporting authentication policies, such as setting requirements for multi-factor authentication for users with privileged access.
      notes:
          - >
              MidPoint internal flexible authentication mechanism is not meant as a central authentication service for the organization.
              Central authentication is a functionality of single sign-on (SSO) and access management (AM) systems, it is not responsibility of identity governance (IGA) systems such as midPoint.
              MidPoint internal authentication mechanism is meant primarily for use in alternative authentication scenarios, such as password reset and identity recovery scenarios.
              It is also useful for emergency authentication, e.g. in cases where central authentication mechanism is not available or it is compromised.

              Moreover, we tend to believe that such a notice may act as a visual pollution, distracting the user from paying attention to more important aspects of authentication, such as tell-tale signs of a phishing attempt.

          Reporting capabilities of midPoint can be used to provide data for capacity planning, such as number of users per application or location.
          Especially helpful are data derived from application inventory, such as number of users and their roles (e.g. ordinary users versus powerusers).
          Role-based access control (RBAC) information can be used for projections of future capacity for new applications, or applications that are being rolled-out.
          Number of member in current roles can provide estimates of number of new users in applications.
          RBAC can also be instrumental in reducing demand, removing unnecessary privileges from roles using role certification.
          Similarly, access certification campaigns may reduce demand by removing unnecessary access assigned directly to users.
          Additionally, reporting mechanisms can be used to look for accounts that were not used for long time.
          Policy rules may assist in human resource capacity management, making sure that all positions in essential processes are properly staffed.
          When coupled with reporting, midPoint can provide a list of positions that are not staffed, or are in danger of staff shortage.

          Management of application service accounts as non-human identities can be used to isolate environments or affected applications in an event of malware infection.
          Moreover, management of service accounts enables application of minimum access principle for applications (a.k.a. "zero trust"), creating natural boundaries for malware spread.
          MidPoint acts as a natural backup-up of user databases, which always up-to-date.
          In case that application needs to be re-set or restored due to malware incident, midPoint can quickly restore user access to the application.
          Role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism in midPoint can be used to manage privilege to temporarily or permanently disable malware protection, driving assignment of the privilege through appropriate approval process, including records of review and documenting justification.

          Role-based access control (RBAC) can be used to make sure all roles and responsibilities are properly assigned to active users.
          E.g. midPoint can make sure that mail distribution list acting as public point of contact for vulnerability reporting has at least one active member at all times.

          Moreover, midPoint can detect unauthorized changes in the application user and access databases, such as orphaned or unexpected accounts.
          MidPoint can detect accounts that are not linked to any physical person, application and service, which are likely misconfiguration or configuration leftovers, posing unnecessary risks.
          Such accounts can be automatically handled using synchronization reactions in detective or reactive fashion, e.g. reporting or automatically disabling such accounts.
          Account re-activation can be detected and corrected, such as re-activation of accounts belonging to former employees.
          Similarly, midPoint can detect unused accounts.
          Such mechanisms are especially useful when dealing with non-human identities, such as technical and service accounts used by applications and services.
          MidPoint can use mappings to correct inconsistent data in user profiles, such as fraudulent changes in user titles, work positions, descriptions and similar user profile data.
          Authorizations can be used inside midPoint to to make sure access control policies are changed only by authorized users.
          Role-based access control (RBAC) can be used to manage roles and responsibilities for configuration management, as suggested by the control.
          MidPoint can be used to report and minimize privileged access in applications.
          Application inventory functionality can store application ownership and responsibility information, making sure that all application have active owners.

      rationale: >
          User database and access control policies are essential parts of security configuration.
          As the primary purpose of midPoint is management of identities, user databases and access control policies, it is an essential component for cybersecurity-related configuration management.
          Moreover, midPoint has numerous detection, management and reporting capabilities that significantly contribute to configuration management.
      notes:

              While activity of usual user accounts is usually done by access management (AM) system, monitoring of service account usage may need a different approach.
              Service accounts may not use AM mechanisms, as they may use certificate-based or public-key-based authentication.
              Direct access of service accounts with hardcoded passwords is unfortunately still quite common as well.
              Therefore, AM system may not be able to capture service account access patterns, as the access may circumvent AM systems entirely.
              Last login timestamps may be the only practical clues to service account activity, which can be processed and analyzed by midPoint.

          MidPoint records all changes in data and configuration to structured audit trail.
          The trail can be searched and analyzed, some analysis tools are provided in midPoint administration user interface.
          User interface provides an ability to see the state of data as they looked in the past (a.k.a. "time machine"), which is based on reconstruction of data from the audit trail records.
          There are also several pre-configured dashboards using the audit trail information in midPoint user interface, with an option to add more customized dashboard components.
          The format of audit trail data is public and documented, which can be used as an integration point with other system.
          Especially security information and event management (SIEM) systems are meant to be consumers of midPoint audit trail data.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint records all changes regarding access control and policies in its audit trail, making it a prominent source of security-related information.

          Identity governance and administration (IGA) platform such as midPoint is a key cybersecurity integration point.
          It integrates identity data, managing identity attributes in heterogeneous systems, mapping them to common data model, ensuring that the data are correct and up-to-date.
          It is also an essential integration point for access control policies, applying access control policy consistently across all the systems using policy-driven role-based access control mechanism (PD-RBAC).
          MidPoint is instrumental in establishing "least privilege" approach, employing PD-RBAC for automated management of privileges, supplemented by access certifications for management of manually-assigned privileges.
          Even more importantly, midPoint is enforcing high-level identity governance policies, such as policies related to information classification,
          segregation of duties (SoD) policies, policies applied to security roles and responsibilities,
          policies for secure organizational and project management and numerous deployment-specific policies.
          MidPoint integrates users, roles, applications (assets), services, devices and any other identity types into unified, consistent and enforceable organization-wide identity governance policy.
          Moreover, automated identity management is absolutely essential for implementation and efficient maintenance of "zero trust" approach.
          MidPoint can automatically manage non-human identities such as application and service accounts, which are essential for establishing trusted computer-to-computer communication.

          Management of identity-related changes is one of the primary functionalities of identity governance and administration (IGA) platforms, such as midPoint.
          Naturally, midPoint provides numerous features to support change management procedures.
          Object lifecycle can be used to introduce new roles and policies in gradual and safe manner, as well as decommission them.
          New policies (policy rules) can be applied gradually, only reporting policy violations at first, transitioning to full enforcement later when the violations are addressed.
          Organizational structure mechanism, together with automation provided by policy-driven role-based access control (PD-RBAC) provides controlled changes of privileges and entitlements even in large-scale re-organizations.
          Policy rules can be used to automatically detect and mark policy violations after a big change, providing opportunity to gradually address them.
          Simulation capability can be used to predict effect of changes in roles, access control policies and configurations, avoiding unintended impact of the change before it happens.
          Synchronization capability of midPoint can detect policy violations that were caused by a change in external systems.
          Correlation mechanisms and synchronization reactions can automatically correct such policy violations, which may be necessary for large-scale changes.
          Violations that cannot be handled automatically can be marked for subsequent manual review.
          Orphaned account management can detect unmanaged accounts created by the change.
          MidPoint can provide assistance in fall-back scenarios, e.g. rolling back bulk changes in access control or quickly providing access to fallback systems.
          Audit trail and metadata maintained by midPoint provide essential record of changes related to identity data and access control.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint provides essential feature to support change management for data related to identities and access control.
          Even though the change management applies to much broader area than identity and access control, the identity-related part is crucial for maintaining appropriate level of cybersecurity.

              Management of testing data would require special-purpose features, such as anonymisation/pseudonymization and/or other forms of data masking to protect personal information.

          which will mostly apply to internal auditors.
          It can be used to pre-configure business roles for external auditors, which can be assigned and un-assigned as needed.
          Alternatively, external auditors can use access request and approval process to get necessary access in a controlled way.
          Activation schema can be used to assign access to auditor for a limited time period.
          Entitlements can be used to control auditor access on a fine level, assigning read-only access as necessary.
          Audit trail records all access rights assigned to auditors.

          This is both technological and organizational control, however midPoint can still assist with access control mechanisms.
