      details: >
          Roles can be defined in midPoint, including all necessary privileges, role hierarchies, policies and descriptive data, especially for security personnel (e.g. security manager).
          Object governance can be managed in midPoint, recording business owners, custodians and approvers responsible for day-to-day operation.
          Such governance approach can be applied to roles, application catalog and other aspects of midPoint, getting governance closer to assets.
          Roles related to information security can be marked with pre-defined "Information security" classification, which will make sure the role are properly staffed and reported in dashboards.
          Regular information classifications can be used together with policy rules to make sure that all security personnel which are assigned sensitive roles satisfy requirements for such roles,
          such as clearance or training requirements.
          This can be used in reports and dashboards to manually remedy the situation.
          Role catalog can be used to organize roles according to various criteria.
          This functionality can be useful to organize roles according to security responsibilities.
          Approval process can be used to configure additional approval for security-sensitive rules, including an escalation mechanism for the approval process.
          Organizational structure can be used to assign collective responsibilities, e.g. common responsibilities and privileges of security teams.
          Escalation capability can be used to maintain accountability of upper management, making sure that the delegated responsibilities are conducted in a timely manner.
          Simulation capability can be used to predict effects of role model changes.
          Application inventory can be combined with concept of "relation" and policy rules to make sure every application (asset) is properly owned.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint is necessary for consistent application of security roles and responsibilities.

      details: >
          Policy-driven role-based access control mechanism (PD-RBAC) implemented by midPoint is an essential mechanism for establishing a comprehensive, dynamic and practical access control framework.
          Roles can be assigned to users automatically (based on rules), manually, or by using an access request process.
          There may be several types (archetypes) of roles, such as application roles, business roles and technical roles.
          They can be composed into an RBAC hierarchy, including (inducing) privileges of lower-level roles in higher-level roles.
          Roles determine entitlements, used to enforce access control rules on a fine level.
          Entitlement concept can be used to model system-specific privileges, groups or other access control means, which can be automatically controlled by midPoint.
          Role wizard can be used by owners of information to set up appropriate roles for controlling access to the information.
          The concept of application can be used to specify application-specific access control rules and policies.
          Roles, entitlements, applications and resources are key concepts of access control model, which together form very powerful and flexible access control structures.
          Organizational structures can be directly used for access control as well, including (inducing) access required by an organizational unit directly in the organizational unit definition.
          Policy rules can be used to set up additional access control policies, as well as constraints on access control model (such as exclusion or requirement constraints).
          Information classification mechanism can also contribute to access control, setting additional rules and parameters.
          For special cases requiring complex and flexible configurations, parametric roles and meta-roles can be used.
          Segregation of duties (SoD) mechanism as well as other policy rules can be an integral part of access control policy, observing applicable legislation and contractual obligations.
          SoD mechanisms provide "segregation of access control functions", as required by the control.
          Access request process with appropriate approvals can be used to allow access in a controlled manner, certification mechanism can be used to review the access.
          Generic synchronization can be used to automatically create application roles from resource entitlements (e.g. Active Directory groups).
          Alternatively, resource entitlements (e.g. groups) can be automatically created for application roles.
          Changes in access control policy are recorded in the audit trail.

          The main functionality of midPoint is focusing on the access control.
          This is a crucial problem domain that midPoint is addressing.
          Without using midPoint or equivalent platform, it may be nearly impossible for organizations to be compliant with this control at scale.
          MidPoint can be the "one tool" needed to correctly manage access control policy from one place and it can provide proof regarding access control policy and the implemented reality.

  implementation:
      overview: >
          MidPoint platform with all of its features is designed to support identity management and all its aspects.
      details: >
          MidPoint can manage a complete identity lifecycle, including both human and non-human identities.
          MidPoint provides a common identity model, a data language to describe properties of various identity types using common data structures.
          Data stored in various source and target systems are mapped to the common model using flexible mappings and expressions, maintaining identity data fresh and consistent across all the systems.
          Common identity data are stored in midPoint identity repository - a database containing all the identities, as well as roles, policies and all related configuration.
          Especially midPoint features related to identity lifecycle management and synchronization are essential for implementation of this control at scale.
          Inbound synchronization from the HR system (or similar data source) is the usual method to make sure access is de-provisioned in a timely manner, as required by the control.
          MidPoint is a natural choice for aggregation and management of user attributes, organizational and group membership, supporting processes for change of information relating to identities.
          Synchronization mechanisms can be used for that purpose, with reconciliation providing a reliable (yet heavyweight) mechanism and live synchronization providing lightweight almost-realtime alternative.
          Proper identity management mechanisms are applied to avoid use of shared identities.
          Synchronization and correlation can be used to make sure the identities are not duplicated, with option for manual and human-assisted smart correlation.
          MidPoint can make sure that "unique identification of individuals and systems", as required by the control, is applied consistently and comprehensively.
          When a unique identifier cannot be found due to naming conflict, an iteration mechanism is used to find a suitable unique identifier.
          Special-purpose sequencing mechanism is used for cases where iteration would not be efficient, e.g. for systems that have large identity populations identified by sequential identifiers.
          Once identities are correlated and identifiers are assigned, projection links are maintained to track ownership of accounts, entitlements and other resource objects.
          Provisioning capabilities are used to automatically create and maintain accounts for users on target systems (resources).
          Identity connectors based on the ConnId framework are used for automatic (on-line) provisioning.
          The connectors carry out basic operations (create, read, update, delete) as well as provide information about resource schema - names and types of attributes used by the resource.
          MidPoint seamlessly utilizes resource schema on all levels of the platform, from low-level data type mapping to high-level presentation of data in user interface.
          Resource wizard can be used for user-friendly set-up of identity connector configuration, connecting midPoint to a new resource.
          Manual and semi-manual resources can be used where automatic identity connectors are not available, managing provisioning requests as manual tickets in IT service management (ITSM) systems.
          MidPoint is designed to fully address de-provisioning of access, as required by the control.
          MidPoint automatically maintains consistency between policy (roles and rules) and reality (accounts in target systems).
          Each access (account) needs a valid reason to exist, such as assignment of role or application, using role-based access control (RBAC) in conjunction with application inventory and other policies.
          In a situation where there is no valid reason for access to exist, midPoint de-provisions the access, disabling or deleting the account.
          When needed, policy enforcement can be fine-tuned using projection policy mechanism, which is useful especially in gradual deployment and migration scenarios.
          Provisioning dependencies can be configured to make sure accounts that depend on each other are provisioned and de-provisioned in correct order.
          Activation mechanism (activation schema) can be used to control whether the identity is active or inactive, using a set of status variables and activation dates.
          This mechanism can be used to set a termination date on which identity is deactivated, manually deactivate the identity, or provide policies based on activation dates (e.g. keep disabled accounts of former employees temporarily, automatically deleting them after the grace period elapses).
          Archetypes can be used to distinguish individual identity types, such as employees, contractors, students and customers, which can also be reflected to the resources, supporting many types of accounts.
          Non-human identities (NHI) can be managed as well, using similar mechanisms.
          When identity duplication is discovered ex-post, identity merging mechanisms can be used to unify duplicated identities into a single identity.
          Personas can be used to represent different aspects of a physical identity, e.g. separating access to regular employee persona from privileged administration persona.
          Individual personas are linked to primary objects representing the person, to be able to hold the person accountable for actions performed with this specific identity as required by this control.
          Apart from the basic identity data, midPoint is designed to manage entitlements as well, such as account privileges or group memberships on target resources.
          Entitlements are usually mapped to RBAC roles, which can be requested, driven through approval process and automatically provisioned.
          Access certification and micro-certifications can be used to reduce access by removing unnecessary roles.
          MidPoint contains an integral documentation mechanism, which allows maintenance of documentation for roles, policies, configuration and practices to be stored together with relevant objects in midPoint.
          Integral documentation can be used to automatically generate core identity management documentation from real configuration.
          MidPoint organization structure mechanisms provide additional, yet essential information for identity management, such as information about functional organizational structures, teams, projects and locations.
          Generic synchronization mechanisms can be used to automatically synchronize organizational structures with external sources/targets.
          The same synchronization mechanism can be applied to application inventory information.
          Flexible reporting and dashboarding mechanism can be used to create comprehensive reports and provide insights based on identity data.
          Audit trail is used to record all identity-related events and configuration changes, which includes all significant events concerning the use and management of user identities as required by the control.
          Audit records related to specific objects can be processed in a way similar to virtual time machine, re-creating object history, presenting an object in a state as it was in the past.
          Essential information about objects and their important properties are also recorded in efficient form as meta-data for objects, assignments and individual values.

      rationale: >
          The main functionality of midPoint is focusing on the identity management and supporting the whole life cycle of identities with proper documentation of each step and logs.
          Customers can create procedures for providing and revoking access to information with proper verification and approval.

              Requirements of this control reach beyond the scope of IGA, mostly to systems that act as a source of information for midPoint.
              E.g. the control asks for confirming business requirements for an identity, verifying it and establishing an identity.
              When dealing with employee identities, these requirements are satisfied by the usual HR practices and processes.
              MidPoint is taking processed information from the HR systems, assuming that the requirements are already satisfied.

          MidPoint is built to distribute authentication information to target systems, making sure that the passwords are strong and up-to-date.
          MidPoint self-service user interface can be used to manage authentication information by users, including interactive indication of password strength.
          Password complexity and lifetime policies can be specified, enforced and they can also be used to generate strong passwords.
          MidPoint can be used to quickly change password or deactivate accounts on all connected systems, in an event of password compromise.
          Reporting and dashboarding functionality can be used to identify users with the largest number of failed log-in attempts, users with expired passwords, etc.
          Events related to change of authentication information are recorded in the audit trail.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint can improve authentication level in a company by centrally enforcing password policy thanks to its password management.

              This control is mostly about password management, it does not deal much with non-password authentication or credentials.

          - >
              MidPoint supports flexible authentication features, enabling configuration of several authentication mechanisms in a very flexible way.
              Even though this feature can be used to set up multi-factor authentication and similar advanced authentication scenarios, this is not the primary purpose of flexible authentication features.
              It is unlikely that a midPoint user interface would be an initial entry point to an organization's systems, therefore the applicability of such an approach is limited.
              The primary purpose of the flexible authentication feature is to support special-purpose scenarios for identity lifecycle and credential management purposes, such as set-up of initial password, password reset and identity recovery.
          - >
              MidPoint relies on cooperation of an access management (AM/SSO) system to implement most of the authentication and enforcement capabilities.
              MidPoint can manage authentication information, such as passwords or passkeys.
              However, midPoint cannot efficiently deal with authentication itself, or aspects of credential management related to authentication, such as forcing password change on the next log-in.
              This functionality has to be implemented in close cooperation with the authentication system.
          - >
              Management of initial passwords and self-service password resets do not have any ideal solution.
              There are numerous trade-offs and compromises to be made.
              The solution has to be custom made for every organization or environment.

  implementation:
      overview: >
          MidPoint is an essential component to make sure access to information is provisioned, reviewed, modified and removed in accordance with policies.
      details: >
          MidPoint is designed to control access on a relatively fine granularity, based on a concept of entitlement.
          Entitlements represent groups, privileges, roles, access control lists and other access control means used by applications.
          MidPoint is using its provisioning mechanisms to control entitlements that user accounts have, thus controlling the access.
          Entitlements are elegantly integrated with role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms, as well as its extension, policy-based RBAC.
          Entitlements together with RBAC and other midPoint policies provide a firm yet very flexible foundation for access control across all applications.
          Access request and approval process can be used to request access, subject the request to appropriate approvals, and automatically provision the access.
          The process makes sure that all relevant approvals are processed before access is granted, dynamically evaluating approval schemes based on individual role definitions.
          Evidence of the request-and-approval process is recorded in the audit trail, as well as in the metadata.
          Certification capability can be used to review access rights at regular intervals.
          Certifications provide a key capability for removal of unnecessary access rights, as well as evidence that regular access reviews are taking place.
          Moreover, midPoint automatically removes or inactivates access rights of entities who have left the organization.
          Identity lifecycle is a key mechanism ensuring automatic removal of access rights (de-provisioning).
          Temporal activation constraints ("from" and "to" timestamps) can be used to limit validity of the identity, as well as assignment of access rights to the identity.
          Simulations as well as special-purpose "preview" mechanism provide overview of operations that would be executed, detecting discrepancies between policy and real state of access rights.
          Application owners recorded in application inventory can be used as part of the access rights management, taking part in approval and review (certification) processes.
          MidPoint automatically evaluates all applicable policy rules, making sure that segregation of duties (SoD) and information classification rules are maintained.
          MidPoint naturally maintains a central record of all assigned access rights, including assignment meta-data: when was access requested, who has approved access, etc.
          Access rights can be automatically assigned and unassigned according to organizational structure membership, either by using inducement, or by using role autoassignment capability.
          Automatic review of access rights at the moment of organizational membership change can be implemented by micro-certification feature.
          Reporting functionality provides various insights to access rights, which can also be displayed on dashboards.
          All access rights changes are recorded in the audit trail.
      rationale: >
          The main functionality of midPoint is focusing on the access control and access rights.
          This is a very important domain for midPoint.
          Without using midPoint, it may be hard for organizations to be compliant with this control.

              MidPoint is built to de-provision access rights immediately when it learns about employment change.
              However, HR data sources are often integrated using reconciliation, which may have significant time delays.
              Therefore, it should be considered to supplement reconciliation with live synchronization for the HR system.

          Supplier identities can be managed by midPoint, including their access rights and relation to supplier organizations.
      details: >
          Supplier identities, such as contractors or support engineers can be recorded in midPoint.
          Each type of supplier can be represented by a specific (auxiliary) archetype, applying specific policies (inducements in the archetypes, policy rules) for each type.
          MidPoint records all access granted to the supplier, allowing assessment of risk posed by individual supplier identities.
          Simulation capability can be used to preview and test effects of access right changes for individual suppliers or supplier types.
          Organizational structure can be used to group such external identities with respect to their mother companies, making sure all supplier identities and access rights are properly de-provisioned when a contract with a specific supplier is terminated.
          Classification can be used to limit supplier's access to classified information based on hard policy, e.g. prohibiting supplier identity to gain any role which gives access to systems classified as "sensitive".
          Application inventory can be used to catalog third-party (cloud) services used by the organization, including all entities that have access to them.
          Classifications can be used to categorize cloud services, according to the provided level of security and sensitivity of information stored there.
          Notifications can be used to communicate security policies and rules for acceptable use of information to suppliers, when gaining access to systems.
          All operations regarding supplier identities, access rights and well as other midPoint objects are recorded in the audit trail.
          Object history functionality can be used to demonstrate changes in supplier access rights over time.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint can manage access rights of suppliers, e.g., by creating temporary access rights automatically revoked on expired date,
          by creating a business role especially created for a specific supplier that can be easily monitored (who has access to that role) and revoked.

              Personal information protection should be considered when working with suppliers, especially if cross-border transfer is involved,
              even more importantly in case of information transfer outside the EU (see GDPR).
              MidPoint can provide an advantage in case that all personal information transfer is mediated by midPoint, as midPoint maintains record of information transfer,
              and it can also make sure that information erasure is properly initiated.

          MidPoint can make sure that access is granted to supplier identities only after all necessary contracts are in place (using clearance mechanism),
          e.g. only allowing access to users that have signed personal non-disclosure agreements.
          Clearances applied to supplier organizations can be used to represent supplier company certificates, e.g. ISO27001 certificate.
          Certification campaigns can be set up to regularly review the validity of the certificates.

      details: >
          MidPoint is designed to manage access control to cloud services, creating accounts, assigning accounts to groups, granting and revoking privileges.
          Identity connectors based on ConnId framework can be used for automatic provisioning, built-in manual connectors can be used when automatic connectors are not available.
          Projection links are used to track user accounts in all systems, including cloud services.
          Application inventory capability can be used to catalog cloud services in the first place, enabling classification of cloud services based on level of security or sensitivity of processes information.
          Role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms can be used to manage access in cloud services, including roles and responsibilities.
          Object governance methods can be used to make sure each cloud service has an owner, responsible for proper configuration and management of the service, reducing impact of "shadow IT".
          Classifications and location policies (based on orgs) can be used to limit information transfer to cloud services located in insecure or risky regions.
          MidPoint can quickly provision access to a new application in case that an existing cloud application is disrupted or replaced,
          which is a natural part of exit strategy for almost every cloud application.

      details: >
          The reporting capability of midPoint can be used to provide information necessary for incident response,
          e.g. it can provide information about the magnitude of the user population that can be affected by certain incident types.
          Simulation capability can be used to predict effects of identity-based incidents, e.g. predict the effect of an attacker gaining a particular role in the system.
          MidPoint policy-based RBAC mechanism can be used to pre-configure emergency access privileges for incident responders.
          Policy rules can be used to make sure that the system is prepared for incident response, e.g. that each application has an owner that can provide assistance with incident response.
          Such privileges are not active during normal operation, yet they can be easily activated during incident response or emergency.
          The goal of this control is to ensure quick, efficient and organized reaction to incidents.
          A reasonable degree of automation is a key to reach this goal, such as automation that midPoint can provide.
          Synchronization can automatically react to incidents, e.g. automatically deactivating orphaned accounts or executing other changes in identity lifecycle.
          Actions (bulk tasks) can provide automated actions that can be applied to a large portion of the user population, roles or other objects.
          This control asks for development and implementation of procedures which includes monitoring of activities.
          MidPoint audit trail can support some aspects of this requirement, especially when coupled with reconciliation and synchronization capabilities.
          Assignment metadata can quickly provide information during incident response, which can be used for quick analysis and filtering of suspicious identities.
      notes:
          - >
              Emergency privileges for incident responders are configured in a form of conditional inducements in the usual (business) roles for incident responders.
              The condition evaluates to `false` during normal operation, can be quickly changed to `true` for incident response, which grants the privileges.

          Assignment metadata can be used to provide information about privilege provenance, e.g. when the privilege was assigned, who has approved.
          This is essential information for incident response, as it may point to affected or compromised identities, and provide clues for investigation.
          This information is further supplemented and kept up-to-date using synchronization mechanisms.
          Especially live synchronization provides almost real-time analysis and detection of new accounts and lifecycle changes to existing accounts.
          MidPoint actions (a.k.a. "bulk actions") can be used to execute actions on a large population of identities during the response.
          MidPoint can help with evidence collection, especially by providing information on user access rights and records from its audit trail.
          Reporting and dashboard capabilities can provide important insights as well, both in containing phase and during evidence collection.
          MidPoint can be a useful tool in the escalation phase as well, quickly providing temporary access to ensure business continuity.
          Object history feature can provide a quick overview of past changes for each object, possibly revealing malicious changes.
          Policies, policy rules and outlier detection can assist in pointing out users that are likely to be the source of problems.
          All escalation activities performed by midPoint are properly recorded in the midPoint audit trail.

          In case that escalation activities are performed outside of midPoint control, midPoint can be used ex-post to clean up the escalation fallout, discovering temporary accounts and privilege escalation.
          Synchronization capabilities can be used for that purpose.
          Automated identity connectors based on ConnId framework ensure a quick response in the containment phase, as well as rapid escalation and reliable post-incident cleanup.

          MidPoint records all operations in the audit trail, including actions of the attackers and responders.
          This information can be used to learn about the incident, as well as evaluate the steps taken to respond to the incident.
          Reporting capabilities and assignment metadata can provide essential information about affected identities, as well as provide insights and estimates about vulnerable identities that could be affected in similar incidents in the future.
          It is recommended to conduct full reconciliation of all systems after the incident is handled, to make sure everything is compliant with policies.
          Reconciliation and synchronization can be used to discover discrepancies between the policy and reality,
          discovering illegal accounts and privileges that were either created by the attacker, or that are leftovers from incident response.
          Such information provides important insights to the modus operandi of an attacker, and it manifests flaws in response plans (e.g. missing clean-up instructions).
          Simulation capability can be used to preview the effects of changes that an attacker would make, estimating their effects on access control.

          discovering illegal accounts and privileges that were either created by the attacker, or that are leftovers from incident response.
          Access control mechanisms, especially the segregation of duties (SoD) mechanism, can be used to assist in evidence preservation.
          E.g. the SoD mechanism can be used to limit possibilities of "history rewriting" by modification of midPoint audit trail, by excluding database administration and midPoint administration roles,

          Policy-driven RBAC mechanism can be used to activate pre-configure emergency access control during disruption, providing controlled and panic-free elevation of privileges for incident responders.
          Simulation can be used to validate such pre-configured privileges and policies and their effect on the system, to make sure they can be used to maintain critical business processes following interruption or failure.
          Certification campaigns can be used to make sure emergency privileges are reviewed at regular intervals - both assignment of emergency privileges to users, as well as content of the emergency roles.
          Segregation of duties, information classification and other policy rules are still applied during disruption (e.g. incident), hindering attempts to create a major access control breach by the attacker or the responders.
          Synchronization capability can be explicitly invoked during or after the disruption to make sure access control rules are still properly applied.
          Especially live synchronization can discover illegal accounts and privileges that were created by an attacker in almost-real-time.
          Other forms of synchronization can detect leftovers from incident response, to maintain security and compliance after the incident.
          Any illegal access can be automatically de-provisioned (deactivated) using synchronization reactions, or manually using activation schema and identity lifecycle controls.
          Provisioning consistency capability of midPoint automatically corrects all inconsistencies it discovers, including policy violations.
          Object marks can be used to mark suspicious accounts and roles during disruption for closer investigation at a later date.
          Should there be a need to create a replacement system during disruption,
          midPoint RBAC mechanisms together with an efficient provisioning engine can be used to quickly and automatically grant access to the replacement system,
          maintaining appropriate access levels for individual users.
          MidPoint audit trail records all changes that were made during disruption using midPoint, or that were discovered by midPoint.

          MidPoint is designed to work with systems (identity resources) that are not constantly available.
          Operations are re-tried, resources can be explicitly configured for maintenance mode, synchronization capability can be used to restore data consistency.
          Provisioning consistency capability of midPoint automatically corrects all inconsistencies it discovers, which can be used to gradually recover from disruption.
          Auto-scaling capability can provide resilience to unexpected load peaks.
          Policy-driven RBAC mechanism can be used to activate pre-configure emergency access control during disruption, providing controlled and panic-free elevation of privileges for responders.
          Simulation can be used to validate such pre-configured privileges and policies and their effect on the system, to make sure they can be used to maintain critical business processes following interruption or failure.
          Certification campaigns can be used to make sure emergency privileges are reviewed at regular intervals - both assignment of emergency privileges to users, as well as content of the emergency roles.
          Application inventory provides essential data on systems during failure, e.g. determining number of users affected by the disruption.
          Should there be a need to create a replacement system during disruption,
          midPoint RBAC mechanisms together with an efficient provisioning engine can be used to quickly and automatically grant access to the replacement system,
          maintaining appropriate access levels for individual users.
          E.g. midPoint can quickly provision access to a new application in case that an existing cloud application is disrupted.
          MidPoint identity repository contains copies of identity data, which can be used to quickly restore the data to any application.
          This is further supplemented by organizational structure, personas and the dynamic rules of policy-driven RBAC, which together form a flexible policy platform to quickly populate replacement systems.
          The replacement system can be either provisioned automatically, using ConnId identity connectors, or manually/semi-manually using a midPoint built-in manual connector.
          Live synchronization can be used to keep replacement systems updated with the latest identity data, as a copy from other systems.

          MidPoint documentation has a special compliance section, which provides overview and guidance for compliance with several compliance frameworks.
          Integral documentation of midPoint (a.k.a. midScribe) can be used to maintain deployment documentation together with the configuration,
          with an ability to automatically generate comprehensive deployment documentation.
          This approach is ideal for documentation of fulfillment of specific compliance requirements, together with the technical means used to implement them.
          The documentation can be easily kept up to date, and the configuration can easily be reviewed when compliance requirements change.
          Certification mechanisms can be used to regularly review applicability of policies (e.g. roles) to satisfy compliance requirements.
          Certification can also be used to automatically review assignment of information classifications (labeling) and clearances.
          Role-based access control (RBAC) as well as its policy-driven variant can be used to keep control over roles and responsibilities for regulatory compliance.
          Access certification is also useful for regular review of security-related roles and responsibilities.
          Organizational structure and location hierarchies can be used to apply variations of policies to specific organizational units or locations, reflecting specifics of local legislation and regulations.
          Policy rules can be used to limit transfer of information (e.g. personal data) to regions limited by regulations, or regions that do not provide appropriate protection for information.

      overview: >
          MidPoint has several mechanisms to ensure long-term retention of essential information.
      details: >
          MidPoint can apply lifecycle models to all object types, including identities, policy and configuration objects.
          There is a built-in "archived" lifecycle state, which is supposed to mark objects stored for record-keeping purposes.
          Objects can be kept around in archived state as long as the legislation requires, e.g. as required by regulations regarding retention of employee data.
          Archived objects can be used to avoid re-use of identifiers, avoiding inconsistencies in long-term record-keeping.
          MidPoint records all activities in the audit trail, which can be further processed and archived as permanent records.
          Retention period of audit trail records can be set, setting up deletion of excessive records.
          Data structure of the audit trail is publicly documented, using data formats that are very likely to remain readable in the future.
          MidPoint object language assists in long-term storage of objects, as the language is text-based (XML,JSON,YAML), clearly defined by schema and version controlled.
          Objects stored in midPoint object language are guaranteed to be readable and machine-processable in the foreseeable future.
          Authorizations can be used to limit access to information stored in midPoint repository, making sure that records have appropriate level of protection.
          E.g. special access control rules can be applied to archived data objects.

          MidPoint provides supporting functionality for archival and long-term retention of identity-related data.

      notes:
          - >
              While audit trail provides detailed record of all activities, it is also quite demanding to store full audit trail for a long time.
              Retention of audit log data may be limited by other factors too, such as privacy regulations.
              Therefore, audit trails are frequently kept only for a limited time period.
              However, midPoint meta-data can be used as a partial supplement for audit trail data, as the metadata records important moments of data lifetime.
              Metadata can be maintained for a very long period of time, providing essential record-keeping information even if detailed audit trail data are lost.
          - >
              Information classification should be considered for retention of records.
              Application inventory, and especially the classification of applications can provide baseline data for setting up retention of information in individual systems.
              E.g. setting up policies to report inactive accounts in systems with respect to their classification, or setting up certification policies with an aim to remove unnecessary accounts.

      ISO27002 guidance for this control is surprisingly brief, given the scope, depth and impact of privacy to the cybersecurity field.
      The guidance refers to other ISO documents, and especially to relevant legislation and regulations.
      General data protection regulation (GDPR) enacted by the European Union is a prime example of such legislation.
      It sets requirements, expectations and best practices that are worth following even in the international context.
  implementation:
      overview: >
          MidPoint provides features that are necessary for maintaining privacy at scale, especially when dealing with consumer identities, external collaborators and similar broad user communities.
      details: >
          MidPoint is built specifically to work with personal data, keep the data consistent, control transfer of personal data and enforce policies.
          As such, it has an absolutely crucial role in establishing and maintaining privacy practices in organizations, especially if the privacy is to be applied consistently at scale.
          The core of the functionality is formed around the common identity model (common schema) that midPoint brings for identities.
          Common identity model gives meaning to all the identity data, allowing establishment of policies on their appropriate use.
          For example we know which attributes contain personally identifiable information (PII), therefore we can control its distribution and use.
          Policy rules can be used to control transfer of personal data, e.g. to prohibit transfer of personal data to applications outside of safe zone (e.g. non-EU services).
          This is further refined by the identity lifecycle mechanism, controlling use and storage of data at certain states of the identity lifecycle.
          For example, data regarding archived identities can be automatically reduced to the necessary minimum (information erasure).
          Projection links are used in midPoint to track copies of information, which is essential for keeping records about copies of personal data.
          The links are efficiently creating information inventory for personal data.
          Provisioning mechanism can be used to set up appropriate extent of personal data to target systems.
          Even more importantly, it can also be used to delete (deprovision) the data when not needed.
          Provisioning, together with synchronization mechanisms are essential for keeping all copies of personal data up-to-date, which is a common requirement of privacy regulations.
          Assignments can be used to track application of legal bases for information processing, represented by roles and services (applications).
          Assignment can also be used as a reflection of user consent, making sure that all information provisioned at the time consent was given is properly deprovisioned when consent is revoked.
          Integral documentation (midScribe) can be used to document the legal bases for information processing as they are associated with roles and services.
          This is especially useful for documenting business roles and archetypes, as they usually convey information about legal bases (e.g. employee archetype as representation of employment contract as a legal basis).
          Object metadata can be used to record origin of objects, documenting legal provenance of processed information.
          This can be further extended by value metadata, which documents provenance of every individual data item and value.
          Use of location information and classifications, together with policy rules, can be used to avoid illegal transfer of personal information, e.g. making sure that personal information is copied only to applications located in the European Union.
          Authorizations can be used to limit access to personal information within midPoint, controlling access at a very fine level.
          Role-based access control can be used to define special-purpose roles for users that need to access personal data.
          Approval process can be used where the roles are assigned strictly on a need-to-know basis, controlled by a data protection officer.
          Policy rules can be set up to limit access to personal data only to selected departments, or only to users that hold specific clearance.
          Removal of access to personal data can be controlled by certifications and micro-certifications.
          Audit trail is used to record all activities regarding use and copies of personal information within the reach of midPoint deployment.
      rationale: >
          While privacy and personal data can be managed manually in smaller organizations, midPoint is absolutely essential for large organizations.
          The minute details of personal data management cannot be easily tracked and managed when the number of identities, identity types, roles and policies grows.
          Automation and policy-based approach is the only feasible option.

          - >
              A very common misconception is that privacy is all about secrecy of personally identifiable information (PII).
              This belief is wrong in all of its aspects.
              Firstly, privacy is not just about secrecy of information.
              Privacy is primarily concerned about appropriate use of information.
              The sole fact that an organization legally possesses personal data does not entitle the organization to unlimited processing of the data.
              Secondly, privacy is not just about personally identifiable information, such as national identifiers.
              Privacy is concerned with a much broader concept of personal data, which includes information that may not be necessarily identifiable, such as information about gender or medical condition of subjects.
              Overall, understanding the nature of privacy is much more complex than it may seem.
              Consultation with a privacy professional is more than recommended.

          This is especially useful for applications, application and business roles and other objects related to operational procedures.
          The description may be used to specify details about business and operational usage of the object.
          Moreover, midPoint integral documentation (midScribe) allows attaching configuration documentation to midPoint objects, assisting in system administration procedures.
          Support and escalation contacts in operational procedures may be specified using group or organizational membership, using midPoint organizational structure.
          This avoids a need to update operational procedures every time a person is reassigned.
          Roles and responsibilities regarding identity governance procedures can be specified using object governance mechanisms, e.g. using concept of role owner in operational procedures instead of using concrete person names.
          MidPoint access control mechanism can be used to automatically grant (and revoke) access to process documentation and other relevant documents.

          MidPoint clearances (part of information classification features) can be used to represent results of additional personnel screening.
          Policy rules can be used to enforce polices with respect to screening, e.g. enforcing that only users that have passed the screening can get access to applications containing sensitive information.
          Role-based access control structures can be set up to require screening for certain roles or jobs, especially for security-related tasks.
          Certification campaign can be used to repeat or update screening as necessary.

          MidPoint capabilities provide convenient support for security trainings, re-trainings, enforcing access policies and spreading of cybersecurity awareness.
      details: >
          MidPoint clearances (part of information classification features) can be used to represent security training necessary to get elevated privileges or access to sensitive information.
          Policy rules can be used to enforce the policy, not allowing access to any user that have not passed necessary training.
          Certification campaigns can be used to update the trainings, listing people that need to be re-training and track progress of re-training.
          Micro-certifications can be used to initiate ad-hoc re-training when a person is reassigned in organizational structure or acquires a role with elevated privileges.
          Provisioning capabilities can be combined with role-based access control to set up special-purpose e-mail distribution lists to manage security awareness.
          For example, a special-purpose e-mail distribution list can be set up for all personnel related to cybersecurity.
          All business roles that relate to cybersecurity may induce membership in the list, thus the list is automatically managed.
          Such list can be used to spread awareness about updated policies, potential vulnerabilities, training opportunities, suggestions of best practice, infographics and so on.
          Role-based access control structures can be set up to require security training for certain roles or jobs, especially for security-related tasks.
          Information distributed using automatically-managed lists is can be targeted, adapted to a specific audience and hence much more effective.
          Similar lists can be automatically set up for all users dealing with sensitive information (using information classifications), all personnel dealing with personal data and so on.
          Additionally, reporting can be used to select candidates for re-training, or persons that need to be informed about policy changes.

          In midPoint, access is granted to users using assignments, usually role assignments.
          The assignment contains an activation part, which can be used to control validity of the assignment.
          For disciplinary actions, assignment activation can be used to temporarily disable the assignment, revoking access rights from user that violated the policies.
          The assignment stays in place, therefore the access can be easily restored for the user when the disciplinary action is over.
          Moreover, the activation mechanism allow to set up revocation of access rights for a specific period, after which access rights are automatically restored.
          Object marks can be used to mark users that are investigated, or users that are subject to disciplinary action, which is also recorded in audit trail.
          Policy rules can be used to support the disciplinary actions.
          Reporting mechanism can be used to report such users.

      overview: >
          Identity lifecycle and policy-driven role-based access control (PD-RBAC) mechanism are instrumental in handling privileges in termination/change situations.
      details: >
          Identity lifecycle can naturally handle termination of employment.
          MidPoint is using synchronization mechanisms to pull data from the human resource (HR) systems, including data about termination and change of employment.
          Such HR data are reflected to identity lifecycle, usually setting users with terminated employment to archived lifecycle state.
          This lifecycle state can be used to deactivate any access that user had, it can be used to minimize the data or handle the situation in other ways.
          Assignments can be retained in archived lifecycle state, indicating roles, organizational membership and responsibilities that the user had at the termination of employment.
          This can be an advantage for clearances that indicate responsibilities and obligations that remain valid after termination of employment, such as non-disclosure agreements (NDA).
          Policy-driven role-based access control (PD-RBAC) is designed to automatically react to change of employment.
          The preferred method to grant privileges based on organizational structure is to use inducement mechanism in organizational units.
          Privileges granted using such mechanisms are automatically recomputed when employment changes, as indicated by change in organizational structure synchronized from the HR system.
          Alternatively, role auto-assignment rules can be used to automatically adjust privileges when employment and responsibilities of user changes.
          Micro-certification can be used as an supplementary mechanisms, especially in case that most privileges are assigned using access request process.
          Micro-certification can be automatically triggered when user's organizational assignment changes, motivating reduction of privileges.
          Notifications can be used as a last-resort mechanism to notify responsible users when lifecycle status or organizational assignment of other users changes, to handle the situation manually.
          Policy rules can be used together with reporting capabilities to detect vacant roles and responsibilities, e.i. responsibilities that need to re-assigned after termination or change of employment of their (former) assignees.
          Delegated administration can enable suppliers and partner to manage identities representing their organizations, e.g. de-activating access after termination of employment.
          Audit trail and object history capabilities can be used to examine privileges that a user had before termination or change of employment, e.g. to improve current policies and automation schemes.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint obviously cannot influence contractual obligations after termination of employment or contract.
          It can keep user record for some time, even record some of the obligations.
          However, the primary strength of midPoint is handling situations after "change of employment", which usually means re-assignment of users in organizational structure.
          Many mechanisms of midPoint can be used in this situation.

              The control suggests that changes in responsibility should be managed as termination of old responsibility and initiation of new responsibility.
              We like to interpret that in quite a loose way, not requiring literal termination of accounts or removal of privileges that are necessary for new responsibility.
              MidPoint is designed to remove accounts and privileges that are not needed for new responsibility, keeping the necessary ones.

          Archetypes and organizations may be used to imply a clearance, e.g. in case that all employees or all members of an organizational unit have equivalent non-disclosure clause in their contracts.
          Policy rules can be used to limit access to sensitive applications in such a way that a valid NDA is required to grant access to them.
          Access certification and micro-certification mechanisms can be used to initiate check of a user (supplier), to verify whether the latest valid version of NDA is signed.
          Reporting capabilities can be used to analyze and review state of the agreements granted as clearances.
          Audit trail and assignment meta-data can be used to review history of assignment of clearances.

          MidPoint can use identity lifecycle mechanism to automatically revoke all physical access when employment is terminated, based on data synchronized from the human resource (HR) system.
          Role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism can be used to automatically grant and revoke physical access based on job roles and responsibility, by including physical access and locations in business roles.
          E.g. midPoint can automatically grant physical access to call center rooms for all call center agents, automatically revoking the access when person is re-assigned to a different job.
          Policy rules can be used to limit access to certain areas only to specific roles or organizational units.
          E.g. access to information processing facilities (data centers, server rooms) can be limited only for IT staff, refusing to grant such access for any non-IT personel.
          Access certification and micro-certifications mechanism can be used for re-certification of physical access (e.g. access to security perimeters), e.g. by managing review of clearances.
          MidPoint delegated administration can be used to register visitors and automatically grant them physical access appropriate for the location.
          Alternatively, self-registration can be used by visitors to pre-register for access.

  implementation:
      overview: >
          MidPoint has numerous features to support management of privileged access rights.
      details: >
          Privileged access rights can be represented as entitlements in midPoint, their assignment to users is recorded, tracked and synchronized from identity resources.
          Given sufficient coverage by identity connectors, midPoint can have comprehensive record of privileged access rights assignments across the organization.
          Role-based access control (RBAC) is primary mechanism for organization and automation of privileged access rights management.
          RBAC can be used to assign privileged access rights to appropriate roles or business responsibilities, automating assignment of privileges to users.
          Even more importantly, RBAC automates unassignment of privileged access rights, automatically removing unnecessary privileges.
          Furthermore, policy-based RBAC is extending the access control with dynamic rules, which further organizes and automates management of privileged access rights.
          Role-based mechanisms and policies can be used to make sure that the "minimum requirement" criterion of this control can be satisfied.
          Privileged access rights determined by the policies can be automatically provisioned to user accounts, and automatically de-provisioned (revoked) as needed.
          Assignment of privileged access rights to the users are recorded in midPoint, including the meta-data, which satisfies the recording requirement of this control ("record of all privileges allocated").
          Simulation mechanism provides assistance for role engineering, especially for roles that include privileged access.
          Role mining capabilities can be used to find patterns in usage of privileges, creating appropriate business roles.
          This approach increases the degree of automation and reliability of privileged access rights management.
          Privileges access rights that cannot fit into business roles can be managed by access request process, subject to appropriate approval.
          Policy rules can be used to make sure requests for privileged access are subject to additional approval step, and cannot be assigned without explicit approval, which satisfies requirement of this control for "maintaining an authorization process".
          Additional policies can set up to detect privileged access in unusual situation, e.g. a rule to mark all privileged access that is assigned to users which are not part of IT or security organizational units.
          MidPoint provides ability to assign privileged access rights temporarily, using activation schema in the assignment.
          Access certification campaigns can be used to regularly review and certify assignment of privileged access rights.
          Micro-certifications can be used to momentarily review privileged access rights of a user when an important change or event occurs, such re-assignment of the user in organizational structure.
          Mechanisms of information classification and clearances can be used to make sure user has appropriate competence for use of privileged access rights.
          Role governance (object governance) mechanisms can be used to assign owners responsible for governing privileged access.
          Role certification provides mechanism to regularly review role definition, especially to make sure that privileged access application roles are removed from business roles when no longer needed.
          Personas can be used to create separate identities for users that accumulate significant amount of privileged access rights, such as system administrators.
          Such users can have special personas with privileged access rights, separated from their common user personas.
          Such privileged personas may be subject to stricter security requirements, such as requirement for stronger password or multi-factor authentication.
          Special accounts in identity resources can be marked as "protected", avoiding any unintended modification, linking or other abuse of the accounts.
          This mechanism can be used to protect emergency and hardwired accounts such as "root" or "administrator", avoiding unintended use of such accounts.
          Application inventory provides unifying view over roles, enabling identification of privileged access for each application.
          Capabilities for management of non-human identities (NHI) can be used to manage application accounts, accounts that represent devices and other technical accounts.
          Such accounts can be managed with the same mechanisms as user accounts, using roles, policies and approval processes as necessary.
          Reporting and dashboarding capabilities can be used to list all privileged access and apply analytics for better understanding and improvements of privileged access structure.
          Audit trail provides complete record of changes in privileged access right assignments.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint provides numerous features to properly manage privileged access rights at scale.
          Management of privileged access rights in medium-to-large organizations without such features is very unrealistic.
          Manual management of privileged access rights at such scale is certain to require huge effort, while being slow to react and very unreliable.
          Strong identity administration and governance (IGA) platform such as midPoint is absolutely necessary to satisfy this control in larger organizations.
      notes:
          - >
              MidPoint fully supports and encourages assignments of privileged assignments to personalized accounts of the users, avoiding use of shared accounts and accounts with generic user identifiers (such as "root" or "administrator").
              MidPoint supports indirect approaches, such as the "sudo" mechanism, or "Domain Admins" group.
              Roles and entitlements in midPoint are designed to assign privileged access rights to user accounts, recording them, managing them and revoking them as necessary.

      overview: >
          MidPoint is an essential tool for managing information access restriction, supporting it with numerous features.
      details: >
          MidPoint is designed to manage access control rules and policies, restricting access to information by particular user or group.
          MidPoint entitlements represent permissions, restricting access to information in applications and databases.
          Entitlements are applied to user accounts by provisioning mechanism.
          Synchronization (and reconciliation) mechanism keeps entitlements consistent with access control policies.
          User records and assignments stored in midPoint identity repository record access rights assigned to particular users.
          Activation schema can be used in assignments to grant temporary permissions.
          Organization units (representing groups, divisions, teams, projects, etc.) and roles (representing jobs and business responsibilities) are used to group users, applying policies consistently across the organization using roles-based access control (RBAC) principles.
          Entitlements are derived from RBAC mechanisms, considering additional dynamic policies, applying the entitlement to user accounts using provisioning mechanisms.
          Fine-grained access control policies can be applied to various objects, such as file shares, data partitions and spaces and documents.
          Access request and approval processes can be used to exercise a granular control over access to information, access certification process can be used to remove unnecessary access.
          Relevant data objects can be synchronized to midPoint, usually in a form of "services" with an appropriate archetype.
          Mechanism of parametric roles can be used to control access to such objects, using relation parameter to specify access level (e.g. read, write, administration).
          Information classification mechanisms can be used to set high-level access policies for class of applications, e.g. allowing public and anonymous access only to applications processing public data.
          This provides partial isolation of sensitive applications, ensuring that only users with appropriate clearances get access to sensitive information.
          MidPoint can control authentication mechanisms used to access information, including passwords and other credentials.
          Reporting and dashboarding capabilities can be used to provide access control information as well as evidence.
          Audit trail records all changes in access control permissions.
          This information can be used for reference, investigation or analysis.
      rationale: >
          Management of information access restrictions is an extremely demanding task, especially when it needs to be done on scale.
          It requires establishing of access control policies, and consistent enforcement of the policies across many applications and identity resources.
          Identity administration and governance (IGA) platform such as midPoint is necessary to satisfy this control in any medium-to-large organization.
      notes:
          - >
              MidPoint relies on access control enforcement in applications and identity resource.
              Applications are policy decisions points (PDP) and, more importantly, policy enforcement points (PEP).
              MidPoint is managing and distributing the policies, being a policy administration point (PAP).
          - >
              This control requires "configuration mechanisms to control access", which effectively prohibits hard-coded access control rules in the application.
              Applications have to expose entitlements, which can be assigned to accounts.
              MidPoint is designed to manage such entitlement assignments using its role-based mechanisms and policies.
          - >
              The control describes advantages of "dynamic access management" mechanism in length.
              However, it is not clear how is such a mechanism supposed to work.
              Probably the closest implementation could be a variation of digital rights management (DRM) mechanism, which is notoriously difficult to use, a mechanism with questionable reliability.
              We recommend not to follow the guidance for "dynamic access management", and rather rely on reliable application of proven and established access control techniques.

      overview: >
          MidPoint can manage access control setting of source code management systems, CI/CD and testing platforms and other software development systems.
      details: >
          Strong provisioning capabilities of midPoint, together with appropriate ConnId connectors, can be used to manage access control in numerous software development systems and platforms.
          MidPoint can control access of individual developers to specific source code repositories in source code management systems, pipelines in continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) platforms, testing environments and all other systems related to software development.
          Access to the software development tooling can be controlled in an automated way, using policy-driven role-based access control (PD-RBAC), based on each personnel's role.
          Developers can gain access to individual repositories, pipelines and environments based on their membership in teams or projects, their access level (read/write) determined by their position or role in the project.
          Fine-grained access control for setting up access levels can be implemented using relation parameter, together with parametric inducements in archetypes corresponding to source code repositories.
          Access that is automatically granted using PD-RBAC mechanism is automatically adjusted or revoked when the membership, position or role of the developer changes.
          Access to source code repositories can be seamlessly integrated with project management, automatically creating source code repositories and granting permissions for project members, revoking permissions when members leave the project.
          Similarly, access to source code can be managed for suppliers, contractors and consultants, granting access as they join a project and revoking it when they leave.
          Automation provided by PD-RBAC mechanisms makes sure that the access will be reliably revoked, keeping risks manageable.
          Access request and approval processes can be used to manage exceptions to the rules, access certification process can be used to remove unnecessary access.
          When needed, special-purpose personas can be created for "testing identities", identities of quality assurance engineers that group testing accounts (as opposed to their ordinary user accounts).
          MidPoint audit trail records all changes in permissions, including source code access right changes.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint is necessary to manage access control to source code and other software development tools and platforms at scale.
          While access to a small set of source code repositories can be managed manually, manual management becomes infeasible as the organization grows.
          Large number of organizational units, team, activities and projects present various needs for source code management and permissions.
          Excessive access rights for source code repositories may remain unnoticed for years, yet they pose a serious security risk.
          Management of source code repository access has to be automated - especially revocation of access rights.
          This problem is especially emphasized in large software development companies or IT consultancies that conduct large number of projects, many of them are relatively short-lived.
          Frequent change of staff assignments, moving people between projects, engagement of suppliers/contractor/consultants and similar dynamic business behavior requires strong identity governance platform to operate in a secure manner.
      notes:
          - >
              Process known as "pull request", described as "authorization procedure" by the control, is implemented by source code management platforms.
              MidPoint does not take part in this process directly.
              However midPoint can control permissions to allow certain team members to review and merge pull requests, "authorizing" source code changes.
          - >
              MidPoint can be especially helpful for controlling access to testing environments, especially of there are copies of production data.
              Testing environments are notorious for lax management of assess rights and poor cleanup of access permissions after test.
              MidPoint can manage access permissions of quality assurance staff and scan the systems for testing accounts that are not accounted for.

          Although midPoint does not deal with most authentication aspects directly, it is an important system to support authentication policies indirectly.
      details: >
          MidPoint is instrumental in setting up flexible, identity-based authentication policies, such as requiring all users with privileged access to use multi-factor authentication.
          MidPoint does that in close cooperation with single sign-on (SSO) and access management (AM) systems, using identity connectors, provisioning and synchronization mechanisms to manage the SSO/AM policies.
          Authentication policy rules can be based on user roles (RBAC) or information classification schemes, as suggested by the control description.
          Reporting capabilities and dashboards can be used to analyze authentication policies applied to users and to identify violations or possible improvements.
          Moreover, midPoint has a built-in flexible authentication mechanism, allowing various configuration of authentication mechanisms when users log into midPoint user interface.
          There is a possibility to configure flexible authentication flows, including multi-factor authentication.
          Information classification can be used to automatically enforce strong authentication for assets of certain classification.
          Applicable policies mechanism can be used to easily mark roles that require strong authentication, or to apply any additional authentication policies.
      rationale: >
          Vast majority of authentication requirements are handled by single sign-on (SSO) and access management (AM) systems, acting as authentication servers.
          MidPoint does not deal with most authentication aspects directly.
          However, midPoint is essential in setting up, maintaining and reporting authentication policies, such as setting requirements for multi-factor authentication for users with privileged access.
      notes:

              MidPoint internal flexible authentication mechanism is not meant as a central authentication service for the organization.
              Central authentication is a functionality of single sign-on (SSO) and access management (AM) systems, it is not responsibility of identity governance (IGA) systems such as midPoint.
              MidPoint internal authentication mechanism is meant primarily for use in alternative authentication scenarios, such as password reset and identity recovery scenarios.
              It is also useful for emergency authentication, e.g. in cases where central authentication mechanism is not available or it is compromised.
          - >
              Control description suggests displaying a notice at login time, stating that the system should be accessed only by authorized users.
              We do not consider such notice to be effective, as the mere fact of engaging in a log-in procedure suggests that the system is meant to be accessed by authorized users only.
              Moreover, we tend to believe that such a notice may act as a visual pollution, distracting the user from paying attention to more important aspects of authentication, such as tell-tale signs of a phishing attempt.

          Especially helpful are data derived from application inventory, such as number of users and their roles (e.g. ordinary users versus powerusers).
          Role-based access control (RBAC) information can be used for projections of future capacity for new applications, or applications that are being rolled-out.
          Number of member in current roles can provide estimates of number of new users in applications.
          RBAC can also be instrumental in reducing demand, removing unnecessary privileges from roles using role certification.
          Similarly, access certification campaigns may reduce demand by removing unnecessary access assigned directly to users.
          Additionally, reporting mechanisms can be used to look for accounts that were not used for long time.
          Policy rules may assist in human resource capacity management, making sure that all positions in essential processes are properly staffed.

          MidPoint has a couple of supporting functionalities for malware protection.
      details: >
          MidPoint can maintain inventory of applications and service accounts associated with applications.
          Management of application service accounts as non-human identities can be used to isolate environments or affected applications in an event of malware infection.
          Moreover, management of service accounts enables application of minimum access principle for applications (a.k.a. "zero trust"), creating natural boundaries for malware spread.
          MidPoint acts as a natural backup-up of user databases, which always up-to-date.
          In case that application needs to be re-set or restored due to malware incident, midPoint can quickly restore user access to the application.
          Role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism in midPoint can be used to manage privilege to temporarily or permanently disable malware protection, driving assignment of the privilege through appropriate approval process, including records of review and documenting justification.
      rationale: >
          While midPoint cannot provide any direct malware detection functionality, there are couple of supporting features that improve malware protection mechanisms.

      overview: >
          MidPoint is an essential component for security configuration management.
      details: >
          MidPoint contains user information that is continually synchronized and kept up-to-date, provisioning this information to applications.
          Moreover, midPoint can detect unauthorized changes in the application user and access databases, such as orphaned or unexpected accounts.
          MidPoint can detect accounts that are not linked to any physical person, application and service, which are likely misconfiguration or configuration leftovers, posing unnecessary risks.
          Such accounts can be automatically handled using synchronization reactions in detective or reactive fashion, e.g. reporting or automatically disabling such accounts.
          Account re-activation can be detected and corrected, such as re-activation of accounts belonging to former employees.
          Similarly, midPoint can detect unused accounts.
          Such mechanisms are especially useful when dealing with non-human identities, such as technical and service accounts used by applications and services.
          MidPoint can use mappings to correct inconsistent data in user profiles, such as fraudulent changes in user titles, work positions, descriptions and similar user profile data.
          Authorizations can be used inside midPoint to to make sure access control policies are changed only by authorized users.
          Role-based access control (RBAC) can be used to manage roles and responsibilities for configuration management, as suggested by the control.
          Moreover, organizational structure and policy-based RBAC (PD-RBAC) mechanisms can be used to automatically grant and revoke access rights.
          Organizational structure can be used to set up policy rules, e.g. to limit privileged only to IT department.
          MidPoint can be used to report and minimize privileged access in applications, e.g. by using access certification mechanisms.
          This information ca be used in processes, e.g. approval of access by application owner.
          Role certification provides mechanism to regularly review role definition, especially to make sure that privileged access application roles are removed from business roles when no longer needed.
          Application inventory functionality can store application ownership and responsibility information, making sure that all application have active owners.
          Applicable policies mechanism can be used to easily mark roles granting privileged access.
          All changes of access control policies, user data and synchronization configurations and actions are recorded in midPoint audit trail.
      rationale: >
          User database and access control policies are essential parts of security configuration.
          As the primary purpose of midPoint is management of identities, user databases and access control policies, it is an essential component for cybersecurity-related configuration management.
          Moreover, midPoint has numerous detection, management and reporting capabilities that significantly contribute to configuration management.
      notes:
          - >
              While activity of usual user accounts is usually done by access management (AM) system, monitoring of service account usage may need a different approach.
              Service accounts may not use AM mechanisms, as they may use certificate-based or public-key-based authentication.
              Direct access of service accounts with hardcoded passwords is unfortunately still quite common as well.
              Therefore, AM system may not be able to capture service account access patterns, as the access may circumvent AM systems entirely.
              Last login timestamps may be the only practical clues to service account activity, which can be processed and analyzed by midPoint.

          Identity lifecycle is a heart of identity governance and administration.
          MidPoint can use identity lifecycle to initiate information deletion at appropriate moments, such as termination of employment contract, or account deletion request.
          MidPoint keeps projection links to all accounts where personal data were provisioned.
          Identity connectors are used to automatically delete or minimize identity data in all systems where the data were provisioned, as recorded by the links.
          Moreover, provisioning scripts can be used to delete associated data, such as home directories or mailboxes.
          Audit trail keeps record of all data management activities conducted by midPoint, including deletion.
# TODO: meta-data
      rationale: >
          The scope of information deletion reaches beyond personal data, some parts of information deletion scope are obviously out of reach of IGA platform such as midPoint.
          However, personal data are subject to privacy regulations, which makes them on of the most important (and most difficult) information to manage.

          Provisioning flexibility of midPoint can be used to provide some data masking capabilities.
      details: >
          MidPoint contains very flexible provisioning engine at its core.
          Mappings and expressions supported by the engine can be used to mask data when midPoint provisions the data to target systems.
          Projection links are used to keep track of the data.
          Persona functionality could be used to create consistent masked data across several systems.
          Mappings can be used to select data elements to provision to target systems, minimizing the set of data stored in external systems.
          Similarly, authorization mechanism can be used to limit access to sensitive data in midPoint repository and user interface.
          MidPoint access control mechanism (controls 5.15, 5.18 and 8.3) can be used to control access to the processed data, as required by this control.
          Assignment metadata, as well as audit trail records, can be used to keep track of providing processed data to individual systems or applications (identity resources).
      rationale: >
          While midPoint does not have off-the-shelf support for data masking, similar results can be achieved by using mappings and expressions.
      notes:
          - >
              Pseudonymity and anonymity and very hard to achieve.
              As the usual purpose of data masking is to maintain some structure of original data, som data leaks (de-anonymization) are likely.
              Therefore we recommend not to rely on data masking as the only protection mechanism, use it only as a supplementary mechanism.

          This information is always maintained fresh through a synchronization process and automated policy processing.
          Such information is essential for reliable restoration of data of any failed application or system.
          MidPoint can use data in its identity repository to correct any discrepancies in user databases and access control information of restored systems.
          As midPoint data are always fresh, it can effectively re-play the changes that happened between taking a back-up image and failure of the system, which are missing in the restored data set.
          MidPoint can use orphan detection mechanism to de-activate any accounts that should not be active any more.
          Synchronization reactions can be used to re-create any new accounts.
          Live synchronization and reconciliation can be used that the "backup" data stored in midPoint are kept up-to-date.
          MidPoint can also correct access privileges that have changed in the period which is not recorded in back-up image.
          Simulations can be used to preview changes that midPoint would do to the restored system, which can be precious indication about freshness and validity of restored data, before putting restored system into production.
          MidPoint can be instrumental in testing restoration procedures, automatically validating that user databases and access control data were correctly restored.
      rationale: >
          System back-up images usually cannot be completely fresh, the images are created at regular interval.

          Role-based access control (RBAC) capabilities can be used to manage privileged access, including rights to install software on operational systems.
          Proper use of RBAC can be used to implement "least privilege" policy for operating system administration, especially for external suppliers.
          This can be combined with organizational structure, policy rules and information classification, e.g. allowing privileged access only to selected organizational units.
          Segregation of duties (SoD) mechanism can be used to avoid accumulation of super-critical access privileges to a single user.
          Activation mechanism can be used to provide privileged access only for limited time period.
          MidPoint can partially monitor usage of accounts on operating systems by its synchronization mechanism, detecting unused administration accounts, which may suggest neglected maintenance of operating systems.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint can cover only a small part of this control.
          While actual enforcement of access control to software installation is in scope of operating systems and privileged access management (PAM) systems, midPoint can manage the access control rules and policies.

          Identity governance and administration (IGA) platform such as midPoint is a key cybersecurity integration point.
          It integrates identity data, managing identity attributes in heterogeneous systems, mapping them to common data model, ensuring that the data are correct and up-to-date.
          It is also an essential integration point for access control policies, applying access control policy consistently across all the systems using policy-driven role-based access control mechanism (PD-RBAC).
          MidPoint is instrumental in establishing "least privilege" approach, employing PD-RBAC for automated management of privileges, supplemented by access certifications for management of manually-assigned privileges.
          Even more importantly, midPoint is enforcing high-level identity governance policies, such as policies related to information classification,
          segregation of duties (SoD) policies, policies applied to security roles and responsibilities,
          policies for secure organizational and project management and numerous deployment-specific policies.
          MidPoint integrates users, roles, applications (assets), services, devices and any other identity types into unified, consistent and enforceable organization-wide identity governance policy.
          Moreover, automated identity management is absolutely essential for implementation and efficient maintenance of "zero trust" approach.
          MidPoint can automatically manage non-human identities such as application and service accounts, which are essential for establishing trusted computer-to-computer communication.
      rationale: >
          Identity governance and administration (IGA) is a key component of secure system architecture for any medium or large organization.

          Management of identity-related changes is one of the primary functionalities of identity governance and administration (IGA) platforms, such as midPoint.
          Naturally, midPoint provides numerous features to support change management procedures.
          Object lifecycle can be used to introduce new roles and policies in gradual and safe manner, as well as decommission them.
          New policies (policy rules) can be applied gradually, only reporting policy violations at first, transitioning to full enforcement later when the violations are addressed.
          Organizational structure mechanism, together with automation provided by policy-driven role-based access control (PD-RBAC) provides controlled changes of privileges and entitlements even in large-scale re-organizations.
          Policy rules can be used to automatically detect and mark policy violations after a big change, providing opportunity to gradually address them.
          Simulation capability can be used to predict effect of changes in roles, access control policies and configurations, avoiding unintended impact of the change before it happens.
          Synchronization capability of midPoint can detect policy violations that were caused by a change in external systems.
          Correlation mechanisms and synchronization reactions can automatically correct such policy violations, which may be necessary for large-scale changes.
          Violations that cannot be handled automatically can be marked for subsequent manual review.
          Orphaned account management can detect unmanaged accounts created by the change.
          MidPoint can provide assistance in fall-back scenarios, e.g. rolling back bulk changes in access control or quickly providing access to fallback systems.
          Audit trail and metadata maintained by midPoint provide essential record of changes related to identity data and access control.
      rationale: >
          MidPoint provides essential feature to support change management for data related to identities and access control.
