      overview: >
          MidPoint can provide essential data for definition and maintenance of security policies.
          MidPoint reporting can be used to extract information from identity data (identity analytics).
          Simulation capabilities can be used to predict the effect of proposed policies.

  implementation:
      overview: >
          MidPoint provides essential management capabilities of roles and responsibilities by using its advanced role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms.
          Roles can be defined in midPoint, including all necessary privileges, role hierarchies, policies and descriptive data.
          Role governance can be managed in midPoint, recording role owners and approvers.
          Simulation capability can be used to predict effect of role model changes.

  title: 'Segregation of duties'
  necessity: necessary
  features: [ 'sod', 'policy-rule', 'meta-role', 'gradual-policy-enforcement', 'approval-process', 'authorization', 'reporting' ]
  implementation:
      overview: >
          MidPoint can manage, monitor and enforce segregation of duties (SoD) policies through the organization.
          SoD policies can be defined on role level (role exclusion) or role-class level (meta-role), with selective enforcement.
          The policies can be enforced gradually, reporting policy violations first, gradually addressing them, applying full policy enforcement when all violations are addressed.
          SoD violations can be optionally driven through approval process to "legalize" them.

  title: 'Information security in project management'
  necessity: necessary
  features: [ 'organizational-structure', 'archetype', 'delegated-administration', 'relation', 'authorization' ]
  implementation:
      overview: >
          MidPoint can manage projects as organizational units, including project governance information (managers, sponsors, reviewers).
          Privileges necessary for project members and managers can be assigned automatically.
          As midPoint organizational structures act as roles (abstract roles), all necessary policies and privileges for project can be defined centrally (project meta-role or archetype) or on per-project level.
          Projects can be automatically represented by entitlements, e.g. automatically creating and managing Active Directory groups for projects.
          Delegated administration can be used to allow project managers to control certain aspects of the projects (e.g. project name, description and membership).
