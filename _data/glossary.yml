  term: Access Certification
  alternativeTerms:
  description: >
    Access certification helps with management of access rights.
    These rights also called privileges, role assignments, authorities or authorizations need to be assigned to the right users in the right systems at the right time.
    Access Certification means reviewing the settings such as assignments of roles to users to make sure that employees have accesses to the systems they need.
  example: >
    An employee works as a manager of research department.
    He has access to various systems and databases.
    He gets promoted to senior management where he is assigned to a new working group and gets access to different resources.
    During access certification campaign the list of his privileges is reviewed and privileges which are not required anymore are removed.

  term: Access Management
  alternativeTerms: [ "AM" ]
  description: >
    Access Management (AM) is a security discipline that provides access to authorised users to enter particular resources.
    It also prevents non-authorised users from accessing the resources.
    Thus the goal of Access Management is to unify the security mechanisms that take place when a user is accessing specific system or functionality.
    Single Sign-On (SSO) is sometimes considered to be a part of Access Management.
  example: >
    New employee is hired.
    He needs access to various resources like databases, servers or applications and is also added to various access groups according to his job role.
    Access Management system makes sure he gets the access on time and to needed systems. Thanks to AM, it is determined what is available there for him, which information or funcionality he sees and which parts of the system he can work with.
  
    Access Management is frequently called Identity Management, but these terms are not identical.
    Identity Management is about managing attributes related to the user such as username, fullName, location, telephone number or authorizations while Access Management is about evaluating attributes based on policies and making yes and no decisions.

- id: authentication
  term: Authentication
  alternativeTerms:
  description: >
    In IT world, authentication is process of verifying user’s identity.
    Identifying the user is usually done by username and password.
    It is a process followed by authorisation when it is decided if user gets the access into the desired source or not.
  example: >
    An employee wants to log in to a working group.
    He provides his username and password.
    This data is compared with the information stored in the company’s database to see if it matches or not.
    This process is authentication.
  seeAlso:
  
- id: authorization
  term: Authorization
  alternativeTerms:
  description: >
    In IT world, authorisation is a process of giving user permission to enter and use specific resource.
    It is a step after authentication when user is identified usually thanks to his username and password.
    When these match with the data stored in a company’s database, user is given permission to access specific systems according to his roles and perform certain activities.
  example: >
    An employee wants to access working group he is assigned to.
    He provides his username and password.
    Authentication process proves his identity and he is authorised to get in.
    He has specific roles, for instance he can add content to this group, but cannot delete other users.
    If he tries to delete another user, he will not be successful, because he is not authorised to do that.

  alternativeTerms:
  description: >
    Internet-based computing when resources like storage, applications or servers are used by organizations or users via Internet.
    Data could be accessed any time from any place, without any installations and is stored and processed in third-party data centers which could be located anywhere in the world.
    Cloud computing is considered to lower organization’s costs by avoiding the need of purchasing servers as well as to speed up the processes with less maintenance needed.
    Due to data being centralized at one place, it is considered to be secure and easily shared across bigger amount of users.
  example: >
    Company creates construction machines.
    It has factories at more places in the world. It uses cloud storage to store the construction documents and instructions.
    This data can be accessed by employees in all its factories simply via Internet.

- id: grc
  term: Governance, risk management and compliance
  alternativeTerms: [ "GRC" ]
  description: >
    Governance, risk management and compliance (GRC) is a discipline that helps organizations to have more control over processes and be more effective.
    Governance is the set of decisions and actions by which individual processes as well as the whole organization are lead to achieve specific goals.
    Risk management identifies, predicts and prioritizes risks with aim to minimize them or avoid their negative influence on organizations' aims.
    Compliance means following certain rules, regulations or procedures.
    A GRC software facilitates this problematic by taking care of all three parts by one single solution.
    It is a very helpful tool for business executives, managers or IT directors.
    Thanks to it it is possible to define, enforce, audit and review policies responsible for the exchange of information between internal systems as well as between the external ones.
  example: >
    John is manager of the IT department in a bank.
    To have enough control over processes as well as users, he needs to have relevant information in one place to work with it effectively.
    If he is able to define, enforce, review and audit policies and map the functions to comply with requirements with one solution, he has better control over the information flow, which helps him to lower possible risks such as information fraud.

  term: Identity Deprovisioning
  alternativeTerms: [ "Deprovisioning" ]
  description: >
    Identity deprovisioning is as well as identity provisioning a subfield of Identity and Access Management (IAM).
    It is an opposite to identity provisioning.
    While identity provisioning takes care of creating new accounts, determining the roles for individual users and their rights or making changes in them, deprovisioning works oppositely.
    When an employee leaves the company, his account is deactivated or deleted and he loses all the accesses to both internal and external systems.
    This way organization minimizes information theft and stays secure.
  example: >
    A manager retires from the organization.
    Thanks to identity deprovisioning, his company email is deactivated, he loses access to working groups, cloud storage and every other system he had access to.

- id: identity-management
  term: Identity Management
  alternativeTerms: [ "IDM" ]
  description: >
    Identity Management (IDM) is a process of managing identities and their accesses to specific resources in the cyberspace.
    It ensures appropriate access in appropriate time and helps to manage user accounts as well as to synchronize data.
  example: >
    When new employee is hired, he gets his user account in the company.
    In this account not only the information about himself is stored, but also information related to permissions for this user or his group and role membership.
    The aim of identity management is the management of user accounts, so users are assigned to correct groups, they have correct roles as well as permissions they are supposed to have.
    
    Identity management can be used to manage identities such as employees, students, customers, business partners or suppliers and finds its usage in various markets.
    Therefore the identity became a new perimeter of security.
    In the past, private nets of companies were isolated from the Internet and connected just through a safe point.
    This stopped to be effective as people started to use notebooks or phones altogether with Internet.
    The security perimeter can be replaced with Identity Management, by which we can manage who has the access to specific resources.

- id: identity-provisioning
  term: Identity Provisioning
  alternativeTerms: [ "Provisioning" ]
  description: >
    Subfield of Identity and Access Management (IAM).
    It is a technology thanks to which many identity stores are synchronized, merged and maintained.
    Identity provisioning takes care of technical tasks during the whole user lifecycle - when new employee is hired, when his responsibilities change or he leaves the company (deprovisioning).
    It helps the organization to work more effectively as its goal is to automate as much as possible.
    
    The provisioning system usually takes information about employees from the Human Resource (HR) system.
    When new employee is recorded into HR system, this information is detected and pulled by the provisioning system.
    After that, it is processed to determine set of roles each user should have.
    These roles determine and create accounts users should have, so everything is ready for new users on the very first day.
    If a user is transferred to another department or his privileges change, similar processes happen again.
    If an employee leaves the company, identity provisioning systems makes sure all his accounts are closed.
  example: >
    New manager is hired in the organization.
    He is recorded into HR systems and thanks to identity provisioning, his company email is created, he gets access to working group as well as cloud storage.
    When the manager retires, identity provisioning makes sure all his accounts are disabled in accordance with the safety of the organization data.

- id: open-source
  term: Open Source
  alternativeTerms: [ "OSS", "Open Source Software" ]
  description: >
    The meaning of this term is very simple - it is something people can wilfully modify according to their own needs or wishes.
    Firstly, this term was known in the context of software, which code was publicly exposed and available for modification.
    Later open source spread widely. 
    There are open source projects, products, participations and many others.
  
    Many organizations and people choose open source software, hence it is considered to be more secured and grants people more control over it.
    This software can also be more stable as many other people may contribute their own ideas, correct it or improve it.
  
    Open source products are free and the creators usually charge other organizations for support or software services as implementation or deployment.
  example: >
    There are many open source softwares or systems available on the market.
    One of the best known is perhaps Linux, a computer operating system with the penguin logo.
    Anyone can download it and adjust its code according to one’s own needs.

  alternativeTerms:
  description: >
    A hierarchical arrangement of authority, rights or duties in an organization.
    It determines the assignment, control or coordination of roles, responsibilities and power.
    A character of the organizational structure is highly dependant on the organization’s strategy and goals.
  
    The theme of organizational structure is closely linked to identity management.
    Organizing the company into this structure, assigning rights to individuals, working groups or project and controlling everything from one place – that are advantages that any high quality IDM solution is supposed to provide.
  
  example: >
    An organization has production department, marketing department and support department.
    Above them there are managers and head of the company, below are working groups or particular employees.
    Altogether they create an organizational structure.
    Their power, rights and duties differ according to their position in the structure.

- id: password-management
  term: Password Management
  alternativeTerms: [ "Credential management" ]
  description: >
    Gives the organization an opportunity to meet the highest security standards thanks to the ability of having access to business systems and networks under control.
    Most of the employees usually pick just simple passwords and use same ones in multiple systems or applications.
    Password management helps to compose strong and unique passwords for both users and resources and ideally takes care of them during the whole user life cycle.
  example: >
    An organization works with midPoint and wishes to use its credential management feature to ensure the information safety.
    IT employee responsible for security sets midPoint’s password policy.
    He decides what characters are allowed in the password, how many times they can repeat, how many are required and how they are positioned.
    He sets minimal and maximal length of the password or minimal number of unique characters used in it.
    The outcome is complex and strong password that lowers the risk of the account being hacked.
