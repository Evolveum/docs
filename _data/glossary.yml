  term: Access Certification
  alternativeTerms:
  description: >
    Access certification helps with a management of access rights.
    These rights also called privileges, role assignments, authorities or authorizations need to be assigned to the right users in the right systems at the right time.
    Access Certification means reviewing the settings such as assignments of roles to users to make sure that concrete employees have accesses to the systems they need.
  example: >
    An employee works as a manager of a research department.
    He has access to various systems and databases.
    He gets promoted to senior management, where he is assigned to a new working group and gets access to different resources.
    During access certification campaign, the list of his privileges is reviewed and privileges which are not required any more are according to that removed.

  term: Access Management
  alternativeTerms:
  description: >
    Access Management (AM) is a security discipline that provides access to authorised users to enter particular resources.
    It also prevents non-authorised users from accessing the resources.
    Thus the goal of Access Management is to unify the security mechanisms that take place when a user is accessing a specific system or functionality.
    Single Sign-On (SSO) is sometimes considered to be a part of Access Management.
  example: >
    New employee is hired.
    He needs access to various resources like databases, servers or applications and is also added to various access groups according to his job role.
    An Access Management system makes sure he gets the access on time and to needed systems. Thanks to AM it is determined what is available there for him, what information or funcionality he sees what what parts of the system he can work with.
  
    Access Management is frequently called as identity Management, but these terms are not identical.
    Identity Management is about managing the attributes related to the user such as username, fullName, location, telephone number or authorizations while Access Management is about evaluating the attributes based on policies and making yes and no decisions.

  term: Account
  alternativeTerms: [ "User account" ]
  description: >

    Accounts are used to control access of users to applications, databases and so on.
    In midPoint terminology, an account strictly means a data structure in source/target system (resource).
    Term "user" is used to describe a similar data structure in midPoint itself.

- id: active-directory
  term: Active Directory
  alternativeTerms:
  description: >
    Active Directory is an identity repository created by Microsoft that stores and arranges the identity information.
    Based on this information, it provides access and permissions to users to enter concrete resources and therefore improves organization’s security.

- id: authentication
  term: Authentication
  alternativeTerms:
  description: >
    In IT world, authentication is a process of verifying a user’s identity.
    Identifying the user is usually done by username and password.
    It is a process followed by authorisation, when it is decided if user gets the access into desired source.
  example: >
    An employee wants to log in into a working group.
    He provides his username and password.
    This data is compared with the information stored in the company’s database to see if it matches or not.
    This process is authentication.

- id: authorization
  term: Authorization
  alternativeTerms:
  description: >
    In IT world, authorisation is a process of giving the user a permission to enter and use specific resource.
    It is a step after authentication, when user is identified usually thanks to his username and password.
    When these match with the data stored in a company’s database, the user is given permission to access specific systems according to his roles and perform certain activities.
  example: >
    An employee wants to access a working group he is assigned to.
    He provides his username and password.
    Authentication process proves his identity and he is authorised to get in.
    He as a user has specific roles, for instance he can add content to this group, but cannot delete other users.
    If he tries to delete another user, he will not be successful, because he is not authorised to do that.

- id: cloud-computing
  term: Cloud Computing
  alternativeTerms:
  description: >
    Cloud computing is Internet-based computing when resources like storage, applications or servers are used by the organizations or users via Internet.
    The data could be accessed any time from any place, without any installations and is stored and processed in third-party data centers which could be located anywhere in the world.
    Cloud computing is considered to lower organization’s costs by avoiding the need of purchasing servers as well as to speed up the processes with less maintenance needed.
    Due to data being centralized at one place, it is considered to be secure and easily shared across bigger amount of users.
  example: >
    A company creates construction machines.
    It has factories at more places in the world. It uses a cloud storage to store the construction documents and instructions.
    This data can be accessed by employees in all its factories simply via Internet.

  term: Delegated Administration
  alternativeTerms:
  description: >
    Delegated administration is a type of administration where chosen users have administrator permissions.

  example: >
    John is responsible for a research project group.
    He adds new users to the group, assigns roles to specific users and also deals with the issues inside of the group.
    Thanks to delegated administration, a company is able to be more effective as the work process around maintenance of groups is reduced.

  example: >
    A company has research department, which is linked to a working group which provides analysis.
    Thanks to generic synchronization, changes set for research department can be also applied on a working group.
    Also if the research department is gone, working group can be automatically deleted.

  term: Governance, risk management and compliance
  alternativeTerms: [ "GRC" ]
  description: >
    Governance, risk management and compliance (GRC) is a discipline that helps an organization to have more control over processes and be more effective.
    Governance is a set of decisions and actions by which individual processes as well as the whole organization are lead to achieve specific goals.
    Risk management identifies, predicts and prioritizes risks with the aim to minimize them or avoid their negative influence on organizations aims.
    Compliance means following certain rules, regulations or procedures.
    A GRC software facilitates this problematic by taking care of all three parts by one single solution.
    It is a very helpful tool for business executives, managers or IT directors.
    Thanks to it you can define, enforce, audit and review policies responsible for the exchange of information between internal systems as well as with between the external ones.
  example: >
    John is a manager of the IT department in a bank.
    To have enough control over processes as well as users themselves, he needs to have relevant information in one place to work with it effectively.
    If he is able to define, enforce, review and audit policies as well as map the functions to comply with requirements with one solution, he has better control over the information flow, which helps him to lower possible risks such as information fraud.
