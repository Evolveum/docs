  acronym: "ABAC"
  alternativeTerms: [ "Claims-based Access Control", "CBAC" ]
  description: >
      A mechanism for managing user access to information systems based on user attribute values.
      Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) evaluates access dynamically using an algorithm that takes 'attributes' as input and outputs an access decision (allow/deny).
      The attributes are usually user profile attributes, supplemented with context attributes such as time of access and the user's current location.

  alternativeTerms: [ "Access Re-certification", "Re-certification", "Attestation", "Access Review" ]
  description: >
    Access certification helps with management of access rights.
    These rights also called privileges, role assignments, authorities or authorizations need to be assigned to the right users in the right systems at the right time.
    Access Certification means reviewing the settings such as assignments of roles to users to make sure that employees have accesses to the systems they need.

    Certifications are often conducted in a form of certification campaigns, certifying access of many users in each campaign, distributing the work among many reviewers to keep amount of work per person reasonable.
    Despite that, the overall effort necessary for completion of certification campaign can be huge.
    Therefore, certification campaigns are being replaced by microcertifications, certifying specific users or privileges on as-needed basis.

    Access certification is often used to address over-provisioning of privileges, in a attempt to maintain the principle of least privilege.
  example: >
    An employee works as a manager of research department.
    He has access to various systems and databases.
    He gets promoted to senior management where he is assigned to a new working group and gets access to different resources.
    During access certification campaign the list of his privileges is reviewed and privileges which are not required anymore are removed.

      Access cloning is a practice of assigning a user the same access rights as another user has.
      It is often used to provision new users with initial access rights, copying access rights of an existing donor user.

      Access cloning is an undesirable practice (see ISO/IEC 27002 5.18), as it often leads to over-provisioning.
      Even if the cloned access rights are justified, business role (RBAC) or similar mechanism should be used instead of cloning.
      Although the practice is generally undesirable, it is often employed due to its simplicity.

  term: Access Management
  acronym: "AM"
  alternativeTerms:
  description: >
    Access Management (AM) is a security discipline that provides access to authorised users to enter particular resources.
    It also prevents non-authorised users from accessing the resources.
    Thus the goal of Access Management is to unify the security mechanisms that take place when a user is accessing specific system or functionality.
    Single Sign-On (SSO) is sometimes considered to be a part of Access Management.
  example: >
    New employee is hired.
    He needs access to various resources like databases, servers or applications and is also added to various access groups according to his job role.
    Access Management system makes sure he gets the access on time and to needed systems. Thanks to AM, it is determined what is available there for him, which information or funcionality he sees and which parts of the system he can work with.

    Access Management is frequently called Identity Management, but these terms are not identical.
    Identity Management is about managing attributes related to the user such as username, fullName, location, telephone number or authorizations while Access Management is about evaluating attributes based on policies and making yes and no decisions.

  alternativeTerms: [ 'Access Request Management' ]
  description: >
      Access request process is a business process used to request additional access or privileges for information systems and applications.
      It is usually a semi-manual process.
      It starts with a user requesting access or privileges for applications.
      The request is usually routed through approval steps.
      When approved, the access is provisioned.

      Access request is very frequently used to provide necessary access to users, addressing access under-provisioning situations.
      As clear and complete access control policy is usually not known, access request process is a practical measure to compensate for this limitation.
      In fact, the access request process is often over-used, leading to systematic over-provisioning of access.
      Access certification mechanisms are usually used to compensate such over-provisioning.

    description: >
        Something the subject possesses and controls, which is used to prove the identity during authentication.
        Authenticator can be digital (information), physical (an object such as ID card or authentication device) or a combination of both (an ID card with a tamper-proof chip containing cryptographic keys).
        Perhaps the most common type of authenticator is a password.

        The term "authenticator" is closely related to term "credential" - which is even more confusing as many authenticators are also credentials.
        The difference is that credential is bound to the authenticated identity, while authenticator does not need to be.
        E.g. password is not inherently bound to authenticated identity, as the same password can be used to authenticate many identities at various sites.
        Therefore, strictly speaking, password is an authenticator but not a credential.
        On the other end, digital certificate (X.509) with associated private key is bound to a specific identity, therefore it is both an authenticator and a credential.
        There are also credentials that are not authenticators, such as records in the authentication database linking identity identifiers.
        However, in common usage, the term "credential" is often used to refer to authenticators as well.
    example:
        Password, PIN, passkey, secret key stored on smartcard, private key stored in a token, fingerprint.
        Physical authenticators includes various identification cards, such as national identification cards, club membership cards and so on.
        Even a username can be considered an authenticator, although such authentication is likely to be very weak.

    Such as "authorization" of a request to join a group.
  example: >
    An employee wants to access data of a working group he is assigned to.
    After successful authentication, the computer system that controls the data determines whether the user is part of the working group.
    As a member of the group the user can read and modify the data (operations are allowed)
    If the user tries to delete another user, the operation will be denied, because he is lacking administration authorizations.

  alternativeTerms: [ 'Digital credential', 'Credentials' ]
  iso24760Term: credential
  x1252Term: credential
  nist800633Term:  authenticator
  description: >
      Information used to prove the identity of a subject during authentication, which is bound to that particular identity.
      Credentials can be digital (information), physical (an object such as ID card) or a combination of both (an ID card with a tamper-proof chip containing cryptographic keys).
      Perhaps the most common type of digital credential is a password-based credential.

      The term "credential" is closely related to term "authenticator" - which is even more confusing as many authenticators are also credentials.
      The difference is that credential is bound to the authenticated identity, while authenticator does not need to be.
      E.g. password is not inherently bound to authenticated identity, as the same password can be used to authenticate many identities at various sites.
      Therefore, strictly speaking, password is an authenticator but not a credential.
      However, when password is established as a shared secret at a particular site, and bound to a particular identity in that site's authentication database, a password-based credential is created.
      On the other end, digital certificate (X.509) with associated private key is bound to a specific identity, therefore it is both an authenticator and a credential.
      There are also credentials that are not authenticators, such as records in the authentication database linking identity identifiers.
      However, in common usage, the term "credential" is often used to refer to authenticators as well.

      Sometimes the term 'Digital Credential' may mean 'Verifiable Credential'.
  example:
      Established password, PIN, passkey, secret key stored on smartcard, private key stored in a token, fingerprint or similar authenticator, when bound to a particular identity.
      Physical credential includes various identification cards, such as national identification cards which provides information and proof of citizen identity.
      Even a plain username can be considered a credential, although such authentication is likely to be very weak.

  description: >
    Governance, risk management and compliance (GRC) is a discipline that helps organizations to have more control over processes and be more effective.
    Governance is the set of decisions and actions by which individual processes as well as the whole organization are lead to achieve specific goals.
    Risk management identifies, predicts and prioritizes risks with aim to minimize them or avoid their negative influence on organizations' aims.
    Compliance means following certain rules, regulations or procedures.
    A GRC software facilitates this problematic by taking care of all three parts by one single solution.
    It is a very helpful tool for business executives, managers or IT directors.
    Thanks to it it is possible to define, enforce, audit and review policies responsible for the exchange of information between internal systems as well as between the external ones.
  example: >
    John is manager of the IT department in a bank.
    To have enough control over processes as well as users, he needs to have relevant information in one place to work with it effectively.
    If he is able to define, enforce, review and audit policies and map the functions to comply with requirements with one solution, he has better control over the information flow, which helps him to lower possible risks such as information fraud.

  description: >
      A process of recognizing an identity as distinct from other identities in a particular scope or context.
      Identification is almost always performed by processing identifiers, using them to reference an identity in an identity database.

      Identification is a process distinct from authentication.
      Authentication is a process of proving an identity (verification), whereas identification does not assume any such proof.

      The term "identification" usually refers to a process of looking up identity data based on a simple identifier, such as username or reference identifier.
      In some cases, process of identification involves a correlation, looking up or matching identity information in a more complex way.
      For example, a system may compare registration data entered by the user with the content of its identity database, in an attempt to determine whether such user is already registered.
  example:
      User enters a username, a system is using the username to look up user's profile in the database.

      Identity-based security is a approach to cybersecurity, focused on concept of identity.
      It places identities in the center of cybersecurity mind-set, adjusting cybersecurity design and practices around identities.
      Identity-based security is concerned with the identity that initiates an action, or identity that is responsible for an action, object or configuration.
      Simply speaking, identity-based security tries to make sure that access to service or information is provided to a specific identity, and only to the identity that is entitled for such access.
      Identity-based security is not limited to identity of persons.
      Identities of machines, services, devices, networks and similar technological and virtual concepts (non-human identities, NHI) are included as well.

      Identity-based security relies on dynamic policies based on the identity of the actor, as well as context of the operation or situation.
      Unlike traditional approaches, identity-based security is not fixed, it does not assume static world where an operation is allowed once and for all, and stays allowed for ever.
      Policies in identity-based security are dynamic, they are meant to be continuously applied, maintained, reviewed and improved, dynamically adapting to the environment and requirements.

      Identity-based security is fundamental foundation for zero-trust approach.

      Note: Identity-based security should not be confused with "identity security", which is a vastly overloaded term used mostly for marketing purposes.

      Process of comparing identity information, with an aim to find a matching identity.
      Correlation is usually employed during identity enrollment or registration, when a system determines whether the new identity is already known to the system.
      For example, a system may compare registration data entered by the user with the content of its identity database, in an attempt to determine whether such user is already registered.
      If such a comparison involves simple and reliable identifiers (such as username or employee number), it is called "identification".
      However, in many cases such identifiers are not available, and the system needs to combine several identifiers or employ sophisticated techniques to find matching identity.
      Some identity correlation techniques involve probabilistic matching techniques or machine learning methods to find suitable candidates, which are later reviewed by human operator.

      Ultimate aim of identity correlation is establishment of link between identities that represent the same entity.

      Applications read data from identity data stores, often using them for authorization, and sometimes even authentication purposes.
      Structure of data in the data store is often application-friendly, containing pre-processed and derived information.
      Identity data store also usually contain entitlements, or similar information that can be used for authorization purposes.
      There are usually several identity data stores in an organization, managed and synchronized by an identity management system.

      Traditionally, directory servers (such as LDAP serves) are used as identity data stores.

      Identity data store is similar to identity register, and in fact many identity data stores are identity registers.
      The difference is that identity register has a more formal data structure, usually functioning as an authoritative data source.

    Identity Management (IDM) is a process of managing digital identities and their accesses to specific resources in the cyberspace.
    It ensures appropriate access in appropriate time and helps to manage user accounts as well as to synchronize data.
    Identity management deals with digital identity lifecycle, managing values of digital identity attributes and entitlements.
  example: >
    When new employee is hired, he gets his user account in the company.
    In this account not only the information about himself is stored, but also information related to permissions for this user or his group and role membership.
    The aim of identity management is the management of user accounts, so users are assigned to correct groups, they have correct roles as well as permissions they are supposed to have.

    Identity management can be used to manage identities such as employees, students, customers, business partners or suppliers and finds its usage in various markets.
    Therefore the identity became a new perimeter of security.
    In the past, private nets of companies were isolated from the Internet and connected just through a safe point.
    This stopped to be effective as people started to use notebooks or phones altogether with Internet.
    The security perimeter can be replaced with Identity Management, by which we can manage who has the access to specific resources.

      It ensures appropriate access in appropriate time and helps to manage user accounts as well as to synchronize data.

      Identity management (IDM) systems are concerned about the "management" side, maintaining user data, policies, roles, entitlements and so on.
      IDM systems usually do not "apply" or enforce the policies.
      The policies are transformed as needed and provisioned to other systems (a.k.a. "target systems") that interpret and enforce the policies.
      The process of provisioning (and "deprovisioning") of data and policies is known as "fulfillment".

      In a broad sense, IDM systems are used to manage the policies and data in all connected systems in the organization.
      IDM systems make sure that the data are consistent, that all the policies are applied, that user profile data are up-to-date,
      detecting and removing illegal access and generally keep all identity-related information in order across all the systems.

      Note: ISO 24760 definition seems to include identification and authentication as functions of identity management systems.
      While almost all IDM systems implement such functions, they are mostly used for internal purposes, e.g. for system administration access.
      IDM system usually do not provide identification and authentication services to other systems.
      ISO 24760 definition is closer to definition of identity and access management (IAM) system.
      However, complete IAM functionality is usually provided by a combination of several systems in practice.
  example: >
      Identity management (IDM) system usually takes information about employees from the Human Resource (HR) system.
      When new employee is recorded into HR system, this information is detected and pulled by the IDM system.
      After that, it is processed to determine set of roles each user should have.
      These roles determine and create accounts users should have, so everything is ready for new users on the very first day.
      If a user is transferred to another department or his privileges change, similar processes happen again.
      If an employee leaves the company, IDM systems makes sure all his accounts are closed.

      The information is usually provided in form of identity assertions (claims).

      Identity providers are often authenticating the users.
      In that case, identity providers usually include information describing the authentication, such as statement that user was authenticated and indication of authentication mechanism strength.
      Identity provider authenticates the users in its own capacity, it never reveals user's credentials to the application (relying party).
      In fact, many identity providers are focused on authentication only, providing only a very minimal identity information (often just a single identifier), in which case the authentication-related information forms the most important part of provided information.
      Such identity providers effectively work as cross-domain single sign-on (SSO) systems.

      Although most identity providers include user authentication, there are also providers that do not (directly) authenticate the users, sometimes called "attribute providers".
      Identity provider may provide also additional information of the user to the application, such as information about user attributes and entitlements.

      Identity provider is often managed by a different organization than the relying applications (service providers), thus providing cross-domain identity mechanism.

      Identity sprawl is a tangle of unmanaged, poorly managed and/or isolated identities.
      Identity sprawl emerges as a consequence of siloed identity systems.
      Users or administrators create isolated identities in individual identity resources, without any means for integration or reliable synchronization.
      The result is a numerous identities for each user, usually with inconsistent identifiers, attributes and credentials.

      Inducement is an indirect representation of an assignment, a relation that assigns privileges, organizational membership, policy elements or other midPoint concepts to assignment holder objects (usually users).
      Inducement has the same data structure as assignment, and very similar functionality.
      However, while assignment represents direct relation, inducement is indirect.
      For example, assignment can be used to assign an account or a group membership directly to a user.
      Inducement can facilitate the same functionality, however it is usually placed in role.
      As the role is assigned (using an assignment) to the user, inducements placed in the role are indirectly applied to a user.

  description: >
      Passkey is a type of strong digital credential.
      They are used to authenticate a user to information systems, identity provides and applications.
      Passkeys are based on public key cryptography, making them relatively strong and secure.
      They may be provided in a hardware form (e.g. a small USB device), or managed entirely in software (e.g. mobile application).
      Passkeys are bound for each website or application, making them phishing-resistant.

  description: >
      Password is a type of (usualy weak) digital credential, meant to be secret, known only to a single user.
      Passwords are memorized secret authenticators, usually selected by users, meant to be remembered.
      Therefore, they are often short strings in a human-friendly form, such as simple words or names.
      Simplicity of passwords makes them vulnerable to dictionary attacks.
      Recently, passwords are randomly generated, managed by password management applications.
      However, even randomly-generated passwords may still be vulnerable to phishing attacks.
      Therefore organizations are moving towards authentication methods that do not depend on passwords (e.g. passkeys), or enroll multi-factor authentication schemes.

      Gives the organization an opportunity to meet the highest security standards thanks to the ability of having access to business systems and networks under control.
      Most of the employees usually pick just simple passwords and use same ones in multiple systems or applications.
      Password management helps to compose strong and unique passwords for both users and resources and ideally takes care of them during the whole user life cycle.

      The term "password management" may also mean management of password on the user side, such as generating and storing of random passwords.
  example: >
      An organization works with midPoint and wishes to use its credential management feature to ensure the information safety.
      IT employee responsible for security sets midPoint's password policy.
      He decides what characters are allowed in the password, how many times they can repeat, how many are required and how they are positioned.
      He sets minimal and maximal length of the password or minimal number of unique characters used in it.
      The outcome is complex and strong password that lowers the risk of the account being hacked.

  description: >
      Security perimeter is a boundary that separates secure and insecure areas.
      In cybersecurity, "perimeter" separated insecure outer network (usually the Internet) and secure inner network (usually corporate network).
      The perimeter was usually implemented by physical protection of network devices and connections, inter-connecting networks by the means of dedicated security devices (firewalls, gateways).
      Security requirements were significantly reduced in the presumably-secure inner network, usually to the point of no tangible security at all.
      Access control inside the perimeter was often limited to access control based on network addresses (IP-based access control), or even no practical access control was implemented at all.

      Reliance on cybersecurity perimeter was a very common occurrence in early years of inter-network computing.
      However, concept of cybersecurity perimeter is fundamentally flawed, as computer networks are no longer bound to their physical form.
      Existence of virtual networking technologies, wireless networks, covert network channels and other technologies made cybersecurity perimeter unsustainable.
      This effect is further emphasized by move towards cloud services, that are located outside of classic security perimeter by their very nature.

      Overall, cybersecurity perimeter is considered flawed and insecure approach.
      Zero trust approach provides a broad conceptual movement to migrate from the concept of cybersecurity perimeter to more resilient and holistic cybersecurity approach that does not rely on concept of perimeter.

      Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is using roles to group permissions.
      Roles usually represent meaningful entities, such as job positions, organizational affiliations or similar business concepts.
      One of the basic assumptions of RBAC is that management of roles is much easier than management of individual permissions.

      A form of RBAC is standardized in a series of NIST standards (ANSI/INCITS 359-2004, INCITS 359-2012).

      RBAC is mostly concerned with using the roles to control user access to the system and other information assets.
      Role definitions are usually maintained using a somehow separate "Role Management" mechanisms.

      Traditional RBAC models are static: user-role and role-permission relations are fixed, set up by system administrator.
      Newer RBAC models are dynamic (policy-driven): user-role and role-permission relations may be dynamic, determined by policy (algorithm).

      Reference identifiers are often persistent, however, they can change, as long as the identifier is not re-assigned to other identity.

      Depending on a policy, reference identifiers can be re-assign to another identity after the original identity was deleted (identifier re-use).
      However, there is usually relatively long interval during which the identifier cannot be re-assigned.
  example:
      National identifiers and social security numbers (SSN) are usually reference identifiers, assigned to a person and referencing only that single person.
      Such identifiers can change on rare occasions, however the old values are not used to reference any other person.

      Consistency constraint in a database, mandating that every reference points to a valid object.
      Simply speaking, when an identifier is used to reference another object, such objects should exist.

      Referential integrity is often a concern in group management and directory services.
      Systems that provide referential integrity make sure that a group points to valid members (user that exist), or that a list of user groups points to valid groups.
      In case a user who is a member of a group is removed, a system with referential integrity will either automatically remove the user from the group, or it will deny the operation until user is explicitly removed from all groups first.
      Systems that do not provide referential integrity would allow such operation, leaving invalid identifier in the database, an identifier that does not point to any existing object.

      The entitlement stays ("stands") assigned to a user indefinitely, until it is explicitly unassigned.
      Static entitlement is assigned to a user by an action of system administrator, by the means of access request process or by similar means.

      Standing entitlement forms a basis of some access control models, most notably Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
      Static nature of the entitlement assignment is often a target of critique, stating the lack of dynamics and flexibility of static entitlements.
      Policy-based access control models avoid use of standing entitlements in favor of entitlements that are determined dynamically in run-time.

      While static entitlements may be necessary at higher levels (especially identity governance level), they may not necessarily be reflected to lower levels (e.g. directory services and operating systems).
      Eliminating low-level standing privilege has several advantages, including lower risk of misuse and less visibility for the attacker.
      Just-in-time or on-demand mechanisms for temporary assignment of privileged access provides a solution for bridging high-level and low-level static entitlements.

- id: subject
  term: Subject
  alternativeTerms: [ 'Principal' ]
  description: >
      An entity or identity, which is active in information system, typically a user.
      It is assumed that subject has an agency, directly or indirectly.
      Subjects can represent organizations or similar "legal persons" that cannot act on their own, users have to act on their behalf.
      In this case the organization is the "subject", while the person that acts on organization behalf is the "user".

      The term "subject" is often used in context of authorization, as part of subject-action-object triple.
      Subject is the active part, a user executing certain action on a specific object.
      In some contexts, "subject" is equivalent to "principal".

  term: System Account
  alternativeTerms:
  description: >
      System account is an account (digital identity in information system) used internally by the information system in which it is created.
      System account is a non-person account, not representing any human user.
      System accounts are usually created to support internal services or operations of the information system.
      These accounts may be used to run internal or external services (a.k.a. daemons), batch processes or other workloads.
      System accounts usually come pre-configured with the information system, they are often "hardcoded" and cannot be easily changed.
      Some system accounts are often used as emergency accounts (e.g. "root" in UNIX-like systems).
  example:
      Accounts "root", "daemon", "bin", "mail" in UNIX-like systems.
      Accounts "administrator" and "SYSTEM" in Windows operating systems.

  term: Under-provisioning
  alternativeTerms: [ 'Under-permissioning', 'Under-privileged Access' ]
  description: >
      Situation when an identity has less privileges than are necessary for the tasks that the identity is supposed to carry out.
      For example, a user does not have all the necessary permission to carry out his usual work tasks.
      Under-provisioning is an operational risk, leading to low workforce efficiency.

      Ideally, under-provisioning should be addressed by automated provisioning mechanism of identity management systems, such as utilization of birthright provisioning.
      However, due to a lack of clear access control policy, under-provisioning is often addressed by access request processes.

      Credentials that can be presented by the holder to the verifier, and independently verified by the verifier, without cooperation of any third party.
      Verifiable credentials do not require verifier to cooperate with credential issuer to verify every single credential issued.
      Only the holder and the verifier are aware about the transaction, no other party has any data about the transaction.
      Some verifier-issuer communication may be necessary to establish or renew the trust.
      However, such communication is in no way related to the holder-verifier transaction.

      Verifiable credentials are often based on public key cryptography techniques.

  acronym: ZTA
  alternativeTerms: [ 'Zero-trust', 'Zero trust security model', 'Zero trust architecture', 'Zero trust approach', 'Perimeterless security', 'Defense in depth' ]
  description: >
      "Zero trust" is an approach to cybersecurity based on the concept of "never trust, always verify".
      The basic idea of the approach is to never trust any system or network implicitly, always verify that the request is authentic both with respect to the identity of the source and trustworthiness of network channels.
      Under zero trust, every request should be authenticated and authorized.
      For that approach to work, all relevant identities must be reliably known, especially non-human identities (NHI) representing communicating services and devices.
      Therefore, identity-based security is a fundamental foundation for zero trust approach.

      Zero trust originated mostly as a reaction to flawed concept of cybersecurity perimeter, which was a common approach to cybersecurity in early years of inter-network computing.
      Cybersecurity perimeter approach allowed for existence of "perimeter" that separated insecure outer network (usually the Internet) and secure inner network (usually corporate network).
      Security requirements were significantly reduced in the presumably-secure inner network.
      In that respect, zero trust can be summarized as "no weak interior", an approach in which no assumption of secure inner network exists.
      Zero trust approach is operating under "assumption of breach", meaning that it is assumed that the attacker already has access to the network, devices or services.

      Overall, "zero trust" is mostly a broad conceptual approach - a set of guiding principles, rather than a set of specific technologies and practices.
      It is currently used as a token of paradigm shift from perimeter-based approach to more resilient and holistic cybersecurity approach that does not rely on concept of perimeter.
