      Ability to store copy of account attribute values in midPoint repository.
      Attribute caching is reducing the need to access identity resources using a connector.
      It also collects the data in midPoint repository, enabling queries that would not be possible otherwise (e.g. combining attribute data, meta-data and governance information in a single query).

      Pre-defined common attributes for each identity type.
      Objects have the same basic structure, each object type specifies additional properties.

      Correlation mechanism detects and decides which identities represent the same entity.
      The usual use of correlation is to find owners for newly-detected accounts.
      Correlation mechanism is querying midPoint repository, looking for candidate owners for an account.
      Identity are usually correlated based on matching values of specific attributes (e.g. personal number).
      Smart correlation can find candidate matches based on probabilistic or human-assisted matching.

      Generic synchronization is a generalization of the traditional account-user synchronization principle.
      MidPoint generic synchronization can synchronize any meaningful pair of objects, not just accounts and users.
      MidPoint can synchronize organizational units to Active Directory groups, applications to LDAP service accounts, or mobile device identities to inventory database records.

  alias: [ 'Identity reconciliation', 'Data reconciliation' ]
  description: >
      Live synchronization is an identity synchronization mechanism processing incremental changes in real time.
      It detects data changes in identity resource, processing them continuously as they occur.
      Live synchronization is quite fast and rather lightweight synchronization mechanism.
      However, it may be unreliable in some cases, failing to detect some changes.
      Therefore, it is almost always combined with reconciliation.
      Also, live synchronization is resource-specific, it is not supported by all the identity resources and connectors.

      It makes sure user accounts are properly created on identity resources, that their attributes are set to correct values, that the account has correct group membership and so on.
      In midPoint, provisioning also takes care of inbound processing, dealing with data feeds coming from source systems.

      Propagation of provisioning changes to identity resources may be delayed, optionally combining several pending changes into a single change.
      This feature helps to reduce the number of operations on identity resources, reducing load on target resources and making resource logs more readable.
      It is a crucial feature for manual resources, reducing the number of operations that human administrators have to carry out.

      Provisioning mechanism in midPoint is robust, making sure that data in identity resources (e.g. accounts) are as consistent as possible.
      E.g. midPoint can deal with systems that are off-line or inaccessible.
      Operations that cannot be completed immediately are persistently stored and re-tried later.
      MidPoint can opportunistically detect that a legal account was deleted, re-creating the account with appropriate attributes.
      MidPoint can detect that a conflicting account exists when attempting to create a new account, processing the existing account before proceeding.
      Overall, midPoint will try to make the account data as correct as possible, automatically correcting any errors that it discovers.

      As all synchronization mechanisms, reconciliation has an ability to correct the values.
      As reconciliation compares all the accounts one-by-one, it is rather heavy-weight, yet very reliable mechanism.
