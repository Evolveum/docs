  title: Access request process
  alias: [ 'Access request' ]
  description: >
      Access request process is a mechanism for users to request ad-hoc access to applications.
      The process usually starts with users selecting roles from role catalog into their "shopping cart", submitting the request when appropriate roles are selected.
      Based on policy applied to the roles, midPoint usually starts an approval process, routing each role request to appropriate approvers.
      Once the request is approved, the roles are assigned and the access is automatically granted.

  alias: [ 'Approvals', 'Policy-based approvals' ]
  description: >
      Approval process is a natural part of access request process.
      Once a user submits access request, the request is subject to approval by appropriate approvers.
      In midPoint, approval process is dynamic and policy-driven.
      As each role may have its own approval settings and policies, the request may be subdivided to approval by numerous approvers in several approval levels.
      MidPoint dynamically determines the policy, summarizes approver decisions and applies them to the request.
      Approved roles are automatically assigned and applied.

      Archetype specifies fine-grain object types, such as "Person", "Employee", "Student", "Business role", "Application" and so on.
      Archetypes are applied to basic midPoint object types (User, Role, Org, Service).
      In addition to giving objects a type, archetypes act as meta-roles, specifying policy and behavior common to all objects with that archetype.

      Assignments can be used to assign users to organizational units, assign owners to roles, associate application roles with applications and so on.
      Assignment is a rich data structure that can contain temporal constraints (validity from-to), parameters and even conditions.

      Live synchronization is an identity synchronization mechanism processing incremental changes in real time.
      It detects data changes in identity resource, processing them continuously as they occur.
      Live synchronization is quite fast and rather lightweight synchronization mechanism.
      However, it may be unreliable in some cases, failing to detect some changes.
      Therefore, it is almost always combined with reconciliation.
      Also, live synchronization is resource-specific, it is not supported by all the identity resources and connectors.

      MidPoint can opportunistically detect that a legal account was deleted, re-creating the account with appropriate attributes.
      MidPoint can detect that a conflicting account exists when attempting to create a new account, processing the existing account before proceeding.
      Overall, midPoint will try to make the account data as correct as possible, automatically correcting any errors that it discovers.
