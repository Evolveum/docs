  title: Abstract role (concept)
  alias: [ 'Organizational structure and RBAC integration' ]
  description: >
      MidPoint supports traditional role-based access control (RBAC) roles, when used both in provisioning and authorization contexts.
      However, the concept of "role" is much more generic and abstract in midPoint.
      Other objects can act as a role, most notably archetypes, organizational units (orgs) and services.
      Such "abstract roles" may behave in the same way as role behaves.
      E.g. membership in an organizational unit may directly grant privileges and authorizations, without any need for extra configuration.

      Access certification is a review process aimed at reduction of unnecessary access in the system.
      It works by requesting certification of an access, a process where appropriate reviewers have to certify that access provided to users is still needed.
      Certifications are often carried out in a form of certification campaigns, certifying access of many users at once.
      Alternatively, small micro-certifications can be triggered, certifying access of one particular user.

      Access request process is a mechanism for users to request ad-hoc access to applications.

      Based on policy applied to the roles, midPoint usually starts an approval process, routing each role request to appropriate approvers.
      Once the request is approved, the roles are assigned and the access is automatically granted.

      Meta-roles specifying applicable policies can be applied to roles (and other object types) by a simple selection in the user interface.
      E.g. applicable policy meta-roles can be defined for usual role approval scenarios, such as "approval by manager", "approval by application owner" and "approval by security office".

  title: Application (concept)
  description: >
      Application is an essential concept in identity management.
      It represents an application or an application-like service in an organization.
      It is distinct from the concept of identity resource, as one identity resource can be used to manage many applications.
      E.g. directory services such as Active Directory are often used as an identity repository for numerous applications.
      Access to such an application is managed indirectly using the directory service, instead of direct integration with the application.
      However, midPoint (and the users) need to know about the applications, as applications and their data are the information assets that need to be managed.
      In midPoint, an application is a pre-defined archetype, making application a sub-type of service concept.

      As each role may have its own approval settings and policies, the request may be subdivided to approval by numerous approvers in several approval levels.
      MidPoint dynamically determines the policy, summarizes approver decisions and applies them to the request.
      Approved roles are automatically assigned and applied.
      Approval process is a generic mechanism in midPoint, triggered by policy rules.

      MidPoint gathers a variety of information during its operation.
      Part of that information is important for a certain time interval, after which it should be removed.
      MidPoint contains a mechanism to clean up the repository by deleting such obsolete data.

      As all synchronization mechanisms, reconciliation has an ability to correct the values.
      As reconciliation compares all the accounts one-by-one, it is a rather heavy-weight, yet very reliable mechanism.

      Services can be used as machine accounts.
