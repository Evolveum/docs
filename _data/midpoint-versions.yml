- version: '1.7'
  codeName: Prometheus
  releaseDate: 18-05-2011
  type: preview
  focus: code restructuring, removing dead meat, get development back in shape
  description: As the very first step midPoint code was made significantly "lighter",
    removing some of the "dead meat" that accumulated over the year of hectic OpenIDM
    development. The code was also stabilized, the tests were fixed and the complete
    development process was brought back to a reasonable shape.
  highlights:
  - 'Removed OpenESB: OpenESB is a dead project and the hope of reviving it is very
    low. OpenESB was slowing down OpenIDM development from the very beginning. This
    does not mean that midPoint cannot be used in "ESB" environment. Just the approach
    was changed to decouple these technologies. midPoint is provided in a form of
    simple Java web application (WAR) based on Spring.'
  - 'Removed Glassfish dependency: midPoint is no longer dependent on a specific application
    server. The primary development and testing platform is now Apache Tomcat.'
  - 'Simplified build: The build system was completely revamped. The new build system
    is much simpler and based on a "pure" maven without any hacks.'
  - 'Fixing unit tests: The unit tests were reviewed, deprecated unit tests were removed
    and the tests that are still needed were fixed. The tests would deserve better
    cleanup, but they are all passing now. And that is how it shall remain from this
    point on.'
  - 'Architecture update: New wiki was created with an up-to-date information on current
    midPoint implementation and also the design. The UML models were updated as well,
    removing unnecessary components exactly as it happened in the code.'
  note: MidPoint release 1.7 roughly corresponds to the features planned for OpenIDM
    snapshot 1.7. The state of release of 1.7 is technology preview. It is not intended
    for production use.

  codeName: Hyperion
  releaseDate: 05-08-2011
  type: preview
  focus: code cleanup, gradual rework of vital system components, user interface usability
    improvement
  description: Hyperion is built up on the previous Prometheus release. The code cleanup
    continued. There were large reworks in components that were no longer maintainable.
  highlights:
  - Provisioning refactoring. The legacy OpenIDMv1 provisioning code was dropped and
    re-created using a cleaner code structure.
  - New Unified Connector Framework (UCF) interface was introduced. This partially
    works around known problems of ICF. It is also a first step in ICF evolution.
  - IDM Model refactoring. Better expression handling and restructured the code for
    better maintainability.
  - XML repository. New repository implementation based on BaseX XML database engine.
  - Relational database repository is no longer maintained (reimplementation is planned
    in later releases).
  - Java interfaces. The WSDL-based interface definitions were switched to native
    Java interfaces (except for IDM Model web service)
  - Basic task manager. Basic architectural changes to support asynchronous tasks
    and multi-node operation are in place.
  - Logging improvements. Logging configuration is persistent and better supports
    troubleshooting of IDM deployments, including dynamic developer-grade logging.
  - Error reporting improvements. Errors are propagated all the way to the GUI with
    a reasonable (and nested) error messages.
  - Automatic initialization. Initial repository content is loaded on first start
    of the system.
  - Substantial testing improvement. Lots of new unit tests, integration tests and
    introduced sanity test. Selenium-based test framework with increasing number of
    automated test cases.
