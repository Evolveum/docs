    title: "No functionality"
    description: >
        No functionality is provided.
        The system does not have any such function.
    useFor: nothing

    title: "Barebones"
    description: >
        Only a very minimal, incomplete and unreliable implementation is present.
        The system is unusable for vast majority of use cases.
        There is not enough functionality to even evaluate the potential.
    useFor: nothing

2:
    title: "Prototype"
    description: >
        Experimental prototype implementation is present.
        The implementation works for some use cases.
        However, it far from being complete and lot of improvements is needed.
        The system can be used to evaluate the functionality and provide feedback to developers.
    useFor: experiments

    title: "Insufficient"
    description: >
        Some functionality is present, covering most common use-cases.
        However, there are still significant functionality gaps, prohibiting full production deployments.
        The system can be used for limited proof-of-concept deployments.
        Yet much more development is needed for system being production-ready.
    useFor: limited proof-of-concept

4:
    title: "Poor"
    description: >
        Functionality somehow covers most use-cases.
        Yet, there are still some functionality gaps.
        Qualities are very limited (reliability, scalability, visibility).
        The system may be production-ready for limited cases.
        However, as the system still does not support all common scenarios, it is not ready for full production deployment.
    useFor: proof-of-concept, limited production

5:
    title: "Acceptable"
    description: >
        The functionality is mostly complete, covering all common use-cases and some uncommon cases as well.
        The system is ready for production deployments is simple cases, that does not significantly deviate from common industry practice.
        Qualities (reliability, scalability, visibility) are sufficient for operation of small and mid-size deployments.
    useFor: production (simple)

6:
    title: "Good"
    description: >
        The functionality is complete, covering all common use-cases and most uncommon cases as well.
        The system is ready for production deployments of medium complexity.
        Qualities (reliability, scalability, visibility) are sufficient for operation of mid-size deployments.
    useFor: production (medium complexity)

7:
    title: "Very good"
    description: >
        The functionality is complete, covering all common use-cases, all uncommon cases, as well some very exotic cases.
        The system includes flexibility and/or customization capabilities to handle unforeseen situations.
        The system is ready for large and complex production deployments.
        Qualities (reliability, scalability, visibility) are sufficient for operation of mid-size and large deployments.
    useFor: production (complex)

8:
    title: "Excellent"
    description: >
        The functionality is complete, covering all common use-cases, all uncommon cases, as well most exotic cases.
        There are pre-configured settings for common scenarios.
        The system includes powerful flexibility and/or customization capabilities to handle unforeseen situations.
        The system is ready for large and complex production deployments.
        Qualities (reliability, scalability, visibility) are sufficient for operation of large deployments.
    useFor: production (very complex)

9:
    title: "Almost perfect"
    description: >
        Overall, the system is very close to perfection.
        There is just a couple of minor details to improve.
        The functionality is complete and it works perfectly for vast majority of cases, including all the exotica.
        There are pre-configured settings for both common and uncommon scenarios.
        The system includes powerful flexibility and/or customization capabilities to handle unforeseen situations.
        The system is ready for large and complex production deployments.
        Qualities (reliability, scalability, visibility) are sufficient for operation of large deployments.
    useFor: production (very complex)

10:
    title: "Perfection"
    description: >
        Perfect functionality is provided, covering all imaginable use-cases, including capabilities to easily handle unforeseen situations.
        There is nothing to improve.
    useFor: production (very complex)
