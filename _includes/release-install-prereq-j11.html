                MidPoint is a Java application, therefore it requires Java platform to run on.
                <b>Java 11 is a required platform</b> for MidPoint {{ page.release-version }}{{ include.release-version }}.
                Java platform distributions based on <a href="https://openjdk.org/">OpenJDK</a> are recommended.
                Other JDK builds (e.g. Oracle) may work as well, but those have limited support for midPoint (see <a href="/midpoint/release/{{ page.release-version }}">release notes</a> for the details).
