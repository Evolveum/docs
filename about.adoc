Site for Evolveum public documentation and other files.

== Documentation Dynamics

We will try to keep the documentation updated as we progress with the development of midPoint and related projects.
However, please expect some degree of "motion blur" all the time, as the system is evolving continually.
The architecture and design are always a bit ahead of the development, and these pages provide both description of what _is_ and what is _planned_ to be.
The documentation usually lacks behind the development slightly, especially for experimental features.
This is quite normal for an open source product documentation.
In case that we are missing something, you can contact us.
However, the best way to make sure that there is a quality documentation is to purchase a xref:/support/subscription-sponsoring/[midPoint subscription].
