= Manual Connector (Built-In)

Manual connector is a midPoint-specific built-in connector that implements the concept of manual resources.
Manual resources, also known as off-line resources, are those resources that are not connected to midPoint by using ordinary identity connector.
MidPoint cannot change such resources automatically.
Provisioning to these resources rely on a manual work, typically executed by a system administrator.
