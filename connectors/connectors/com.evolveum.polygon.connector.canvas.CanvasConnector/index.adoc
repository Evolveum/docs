= Canvas LMS Connector

Connector for Canvas LMS teaching and learning software.

This supports Canvas user management and simple enrollment of students and teachers for courses.
Both course-level roles are configurable and any other enrollments will not be touched by the connector.
Courses are not managed, they are only read-only list of entitlements so the associations can be managed.
