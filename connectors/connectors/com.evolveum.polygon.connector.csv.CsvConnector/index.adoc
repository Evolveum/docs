This connector is useful to connect to systems that regularly export or import user databases in a form of CSV files.
It is usually used to connect to HR-like systems that export the HR data every night.
MidPoint deployments are usually using this connector to pull that data.
This connector pretends that the CSV file is actually the complete resource.
Therefore, the usual configuration of an authoritative resource can be used to connect such an export-based resource.

This connector can also be used as a remote connector if the file is on a different machine than midPoint.

// Later: This will be moved to individual connector version page (automatically generated)
// Maybe we want to keep summary of the latest version here

== Interoperability

This connector was developed using standard Java I/O libraries.
It relies on Java platform for all I/O operations, including potentially problematic operations that involve concurrent and remote access to files.
The capabilities of the Java platform on specific operating systems and filesystems may be limited.

The connector is only tested using local files on standard local filesystems in Linux and Windows environments.
Network filesystems are not tested - although we have reports that this connector works with some network filesystems.


== Support

This connector is bundled with midPoint distribution, therefore it is a subject to xref:/support/bundled-support/[bundled support] program.
Such bundled support includes only support for local files on standard local filesystems in Linux and Windows environment (ext4 and NTFS file systems).
Other operating systems are not supported.
Network file systems and unusual (experimental) filesystems are not supported.

Support for other operating systems, remote or unusual filesystems has to be explicitly negotiated in a support contract.
