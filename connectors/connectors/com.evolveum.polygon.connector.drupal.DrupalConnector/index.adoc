Connector for Drupal 7, based on polygon's link:https://github.com/Evolveum/polygon/tree/master/connector-rest[connector-rest]. You need to enable JSON REST API in drupal 7 over link:https://www.drupal.org/project/services[Services 3.x] module.
For security reason please use HTTP Basic authentication or whitelist midPoint IP addresses that will bypass general HTTP auth. Also, use HTTPS, user passwords are transferred as plain text in JSON body.
