== History

Connector was introduced as a contribution to midPoint project by AMI Praha.

Google Apps Connector contains support for ACCOUNT and GROUP (mailing lists entities). However, as the original connector contains support for more entity types, not all of those were fully tested with midPoint. Current focus is on ACCOUNT entity.


== Overview

Google Apps is a Software-as-a-Service platform (SaaS), that provides email, calendar, documents and other services.
This connector uses the Google Apps provisioning APIs to add, modify and delete user accounts and email aliases.

[TIP]
.Premium only
====
Please note that only the Premium (paid) or Educational versions of Google Apps provide access to the provisioning APIs.
