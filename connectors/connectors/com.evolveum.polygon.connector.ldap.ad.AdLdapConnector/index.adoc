= Active Directory Connector (LDAP)

== Capabilities and Features

// Later: This will be moved to individual connector version page (automatically generated)
// Maybe we want to keep summary of the latest version here

[%autowidth,cols="h,1,1"]
|===
| Schema | YES | Determined from standard LDAP schema, experimental support for native AD schema.

| Provisioning
| YES
|

| Live Synchronization
| YES
| Active Directory DirSync synchronization supported.^1)^

| Password
| YES
|

| Activation
| YES
| Activation using the userAccountControl attribute.

| Paging support
| YES
| Simple Paged Results and VLV

| Native attribute names
| YES
| Use `ri:dn` instead of `icfs:name`.
Use `ri:GUID` instead of `icfs:uid`.

| Scripting
| NO
| Use of dedicated scripting connectors (SSH, PowerHell) is recommended.

| Last login date
| YES
| Using configuration property where user can pick between `lastLogon` and `lastLogonTimestamp` attribute.
It is important to note that the intended purpose of the `lastLogonTimestamp` attribute to help identify
inactive computer and user accounts. The `lastLogon` attribute is not designed to provide real time logon
information. With default settings in place the `lastLogonTimestamp` will be 9-14 days behind the current date.

For more info see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/askds/the-lastlogontimestamp-attribute-what-it-was-designed-for-and-how-it-works[documentation].

|===

1) For the DirSync synchronization the *DS-Replication-Get-Changes* ( 1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2 ) extended right has to be granted.

== Interoperability

Following versions of Active Directory are supported:

* Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Windows Server 2022
* Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Windows Server 2019

Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) or any other variants of Active Directory or related services are NOT supported.

The connector supports only a subset of the operations that are available by using LDAP protocol and at the same time are documented in public Microsoft documentation.
The connector does *not* claim to support all AD operations and complete AD functionality.
Basic provisioning functionality is supported and it is tested in numerous real-world deployments.
But advanced functionality may not be supported at all.
Active Directory is a complex, proprietary and heavily non-standard system.
It is not possible for the connector to support all the available operations.
We recommend conducting a feasibility testing before deploying this connector.
In case some connector functionality is missing then we recommend to purchase xref:/support/subscription-sponsoring/[midPoint platform subscription] to cover the functionality gap.

.Unsupported Active Directory Versions
[NOTE]
====
Following Active Directory versions (including their variants) are no longer supported, as they are not covered by regular (mainstream) support from Microsoft:

* Active Directory 2016
* Active Directory 2012, including 2012R2
* Active Directory 2008, including 2008R2

Please see xref:/support/connected-systems.adoc[Evolveum support policy details].
====

=== Known Limitations

* Synchronization based on modifyTimestamp has a simplistic implementation.
It does not support SPR, VLV or referral-following functionality.
This synchronization method is inherently inefficient and unreliable.
It should be used only as a last resort, if no other method is available.
Active Directory DirSync method should be preferred whenever available.

* Minimal xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/#fetch-strategy[fetch strategy] does not work reliably.
LDAP has no way to specify that the connector wants to fetch all regular attributes except for one.
Therefore, the connector has to list all the other attributes of an object, except the one expensive attribute (such as `jpegPhoto` or `member`).
However, Active Directory has attributes that cannot be used it a regular (subtree) search.
If the list of attributes happen to contain such an "unsearchable" attribute, the request fails.
Even worse, AD is not exposing information about search limitations in standard LDAP schema.
Therefore, this LDAP-based connector has no way to find out which attributes are not searchable.
+
A symptom of this problem is usually an error: `00002120: SvcErr: DSID-......., problem 5012` a.k.a. `ERROR_DS_NON_BASE_SEARCH`.
+
Possible solution is to use non-standard schema definition data structures which are native to Active Directory.
However, this code is not production-ready yet.

* LDAP connector 3.4 introduced a fail-over mechanism for LDAP servers.
However, this mechanism is designed for standard-compliant LDAP server (which AD is not), and it was not tested with Active Directory.
Therefore, the fail-over mechanism is *not supported* for Active Directory.

* Newer version of AD may not support VLV paging strategy (recognized on Win2022).
In case of higher amount of the objects the "Fatal error" is shown under *Resource objects* listing.
+
A symptom of this problem is usually an error: `000020EF: SvcErr: DSID-........, problem 5010 (UNAVAIL_EXTENSION)`.
+
In case you are facing this issue the solution would be setting *pagingStrategy* to *spr*.

* There are specific limitations for the xref:#_native_references[Native References] capability, see xref:#_native_references_limitations[below].


=== MS Exchange Interoperability

Technically, this connector can be used to provision Microsoft Exchange servers in an indirect way by using PowerShell scripts.

Firstly, the Exchange attributes are accessible in Active Directory when the Exchange software is installed.
The AD/LDAP connector dynamically discovers AD schema and therefore it will discover presence of these attributes.
Then these attributes can be manipulated in a normal way.
Please note that some Exchange attributes may not be properly propagated in the AD LDAP schema.
In such case there is a workaround to specify these attributes in the `operationalAttributes` connector configuration property.

Secondly, since version 1.4.2.18 the connector had support to execute commands and powershell scripts remotely using the WinRM interface.
This feature can be used to manage Exchange mailboxes and additional settings.
This feature was later "separated" to a dedicated PowerShell scripting connector.
Please see xref:/connectors/resources/active-directory/powershell/[Powershell Support in AD/LDAP Connector] page for more details.

However, support for MS Exchange is *not*  included in the "bundled" support for this connector (see below).

fixes handling of __ENABLE__ attribute

This connector is based on the xref:../com.evolveum.polygon.connector.ldap.LdapConnector/[LDAP Connector] which was completely rewritten from scratch during 2015-2016.

== Support

This connector is bundled with midPoint distribution.
Support for LDAP connector is included in standard midPoint support service (a.k.a xref:/support/bundled-support/[bundled support]) - however, there are limitations:

* Only some Active Directory versions are supported (see above)

* Only some Active Directory features are supported (see above).
The connector *does not claim to be feature-complete*. We recommend conducting a feasibility testing before deploying this connector.
In case some connector functionality is missing then we recommend to purchase xref:/support/subscription-sponsoring/[midPoint platform subscription] to cover the functionality gap.

* PowerShell scripting implemented in this connector is supposed to be used to supplement creation of Active Directory (windows) accounts by using simple scripts.
It is not supposed to be used to manage Microsoft Exchange accounts.
Management of Exchange accounts can be quite a complex matter, requiring complicated PowerShell scripts.
Support for the use of this connector to manage Exchange accounts has to be purchased separately.

[TIP]
====
There may be exception to this rule for the customers that purchased support before the release of midPoint 4.0. In case of any doubts please contact Evolveum sales representatives.
====

When dealing with connector issues, please make sure to follow xref:../com.evolveum.polygon.connector.ldap.LdapConnector/troubleshooting/[LDAP Connector Troubleshooting Guide].

== Licensing

The connector itself is available under the terms of Apache License 2.0. The connector is using only the LDAP protocol to access Active Directory.
We are not using any Microsoft library or any other component that might be subject to Microsoft licensing.
To our best knowledge no extra license is needed to use the connector with Active Directory.
However the Microsoft license texts are not entirely clear and we are not lawyers.
Therefore it is recommended for each user to make his own analysis of the licensing issues.
Please use your Microsoft support program and contact Microsoft with the licensing question when in doubt.

== Notes

This connector is contained in LDAP connector bundle, which also contains LDAP connector.
Both connectors are specializations of the LDAP connectors.
The Active Directory connector has additional support for the LDAP quirks needed to work with AD.

=== ConnId Result Handlers

[WARNING]
====
We strongly recommend to disable all the handlers when working with well-designed connectors in general and when working with our LDAP or xref:/connectors/connectors/com.evolveum.polygon.connector.ldap.ad.AdLdapConnector/[AD/LDAP] connectors in particular.
====

Those "result handlers" are an artifact of an original xref:/connectors/connid/1.x/icf-issues/[original Identity Connector Framework over-engineering]. The handlers are supposed to assist connectors by implementing "mechanism" that the connector or resource does not support - such as search result filtering, data normalization and so on.
However, those handler are generic and they know nothing about the particulars of the resource that the connector connects to.
Therefore in vast majority of cases those handlers just get into the way and they distort the data.
Good connectors usually do not need those handlers at all.
Unfortunately, these handler are enabled by default and there is no way for a connector to tell the framework to turn them off.
The handlers needs to be explicitly disabled in the resource configuration.

[source,xml]
----
<icfs:resultsHandlerConfiguration>
  <icfs:enableNormalizingResultsHandler>false</icfs:enableNormalizingResultsHandler>
  <icfs:enableFilteredResultsHandler>false</icfs:enableFilteredResultsHandler>
  <icfs:enableAttributesToGetSearchResultsHandler>false</icfs:enableAttributesToGetSearchResultsHandler>
</icfs:resultsHandlerConfiguration>
----

=== ObjectClass Filters

Natural way to use LDAP is to use "short" search filters, such as `(cn=foo)`. However, such search filter can match objects of several incompatible objectclasses, producing incorrect results.
Therefore a strict way to construct a search filter is to always add an objectclass clause to the filter, resulting in `(&(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)(cn=foo))` filter.
Use of such search filter ensures that the results will be correct.

This search filter should work flawlessly on standard-compliance and correctly-configured LDAP servers.
Therefore since connector version 3.2, use of such search filters is tuned on by default.
However, such search filters may cause issues on non-compliant and/or incorrectly configured and populated servers.
In such case, the behavior can be controlled by `includeObjectClassFilter` configuration property.

[#_native_references]
== Native References

Starting from the connector version 3.8, the LDAP connector is capable of working with _reference attributes_ that describe the relation between resource objects, like between accounts and groups they are members of.

This behavior is governed by the `managedAssociationPairs` multivalued configuration property.

Each value of this property is a string with a specific formatting convention.
Based on this information the connector figures out which object classes have a relation between each other and also which attributes should be used for such relation.

.An example: Defining a relation between `user` and `group`
[#_example_m_association_pairs_one]
[source,xml]
----
<connectorConfiguration>
    <configurationProperties>
        <host>primary.ldap.example.com</host>
        <baseContext>dc=evolveum,dc=com</baseContext>
        <operationalAttributes>memberOf</operationalAttributes>
        <managedAssociationPairs>"user"+memberOf -# "group"+member</managedAssociationPairs>
        ...
    </configurationProperties>
</connectorConfiguration>
----

The value of `"user"+memberOf -# "group"+member` specifies that:

* Object classes `user` and `group` are in a relationship.
* `user` is the *subject* (the one who receives an entitlement), while `group` is the *object* (the entitlement being granted).
* The binding attributes on the `user` side is `memberOf`.
The related groups for a given account are determined by looking at this attribute.
* The binding attribute on the `group` side is `member`.
The related members are determined by looking at this attribute.
Also, this attribute is used to update the membership information.

[#_note_subject_object]
[NOTE]
====
*Subject and object*

As mentioned above,

* *subject* is the resource object which receives an entitlement, typically an account;
* *object* is the resource object which represents an entitlement, typically a group.

They have a relation between them, typically, a subject (an account) is member of a group.
More information about this topic can be found in xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/entitlements/[Entitlements and Associations].
====

The `managedAssociationPairs` values have the following formatting convention:

     "SubjectObjectClassName"+SubjectAttribute -# "ObjectObjectClassName"+ObjectAttribute

* `SubjectObjectClassName` is the object class representing the _subject_ of this relation.
* `SubjectAttribute` is the attribute of that object class containing the list of related objects, typically groups that the account is a member of.
* `ObjectObjectClassName` is the object class representing the _object_ of this relation.
* `ObjectAttribute` is the attribute of that object class containing the list of related subjects, typically the members of the group.

By using the above example, the connector will manage the relations between the object class `user`
and the object class `group` based on the values present in the parameters `memberOf` (for `user`) and `member` (for `group`).

As this is a multivalued property, you can specify multiple pairs of object types, each of them having a relation between them marked as managed by the connector.

        <managedAssociationPairs>"user"+memberOf -# "group"+member</managedAssociationPairs>

        ...
    </configurationProperties>
</connectorConfiguration>

The addition of this parameter will signal to the connector that it should use the native references handling.
This also changes the way the schema is generated by the connector, see below.

=== Representation of Native References in the Schema

When you define the relation between object classes, the following changes automatically occur:

. The original attributes used to provide the relation, e.g. `memberOf` and `member` in the above examples, will disappear from the schema.
. The subject-side attribute, e.g. `memberOf`, will be replaced by the reference attribute `group`.
. The object-side attribute, e.g. `member`, will be replaced by the reference attribute `member`.

Both of the attributes, `group` and `member`, are currently constants in the connector code.

Reference attributes are special kinds of attributes that do not have simple values (string, integer, and so on), but contain _references_ to other objects.

NOTE: The new `member` attribute on the object (entitlement) side is marked as "not readable" and "not returned by default", because fetching of this attribute is not currently supported by midPoint.

If you already have a schema generated before the xref:#_native_references[Native References] configuration has been set up, you have to refresh the connector schema.

=== Other Things to Consider

If you use operational attributes in the values for the `managedAssociationPairs` configuration property, please also specify these attributes in the `operationalAttributes` configuration property.
As we can see in the xref:#_example_m_association_pairs_one[example] above.

In rare cases, when using an "Object" object class (i.e. `group`) which is extended via an auxiliary object class, please also add the `auxiliaryObjectClasses` xref:#_auxiliary_object_classes[configuration property] to your resource configuration, and specify the auxiliary object classes which are used.
The reason for this is that, the object-side attribute (i.e. `member`) is, in some cases, explicitly removed from object searches.

[#_native_references_limitations]
=== Limitations

. This feature assumes that there is the `memberOf` (or equivalent) attribute on the subject size that is used to provide the membership information.
+
NOTE: If this attribute is missing, the native references feature of the connector cannot be used.

. Only one class of objects (entitlements) is supported per subject-object relation (e.g., for `memberOf` attribute of `user`, we assume that all referenced objects will be of the object class `group`).

. Events related to object relations (like adding or deleting a group membership to an account) cannot be currently detected by the live synchronization.

. The connector does not handle 'primary groups' as a part of the entitlements managed by the native association handling.

[#_attributes_not_returned_by_default]
=== Marking Attributes as Not Returned by Default

The `attributesNotReturnedByDefault` parameter gives us the possibility to mark some of the standard attributes of the resource object with the `NOT_RETURNED_BY_DEFAULT` flag.
Such attributes will be by default omitted from ldap search requests, unless the IAM explicitly requests them.
We can use this configuration if some attributes are too large or expensive to retrieve (i.e. the `member` attribute).

The attributes specified in this property will be marked as `NOT_RETURNED_BY_DEFAULT` for all object classes.

If you already have a schema generated and add or modify this property in your configuration, you will have to refresh the connector schema.

If you are intending to use this configuration property, and your object classes are extended via an auxiliary object class, please also add the `auxiliaryObjectClasses` xref:#_auxiliary_object_classes[configuration property] to your configuration.

[#_auxiliary_object_classes]
=== Auxiliary Object Classes

The current implementation of the connector uses a wildcard (`*`) to return all non-operational attributes of an object in a search request, operational attributes are added to the request explicitly.
In some cases we need to explicitly enumerate the non-operational attributes as well (rather than use a wildcard).
The only problem here is that the connector does not know about the Auxiliary Object Classes, and is not capable of requesting the proper non-structural objectClass attributes.

The solution to this is to specify the Auxiliary Object Classes as values of the `auxiliaryObjectClasses` configuration property.
Each value of this property is a string following a specific convention.

.An example: Defining the structural object class `user` with an auxiliary object class `posixAccount`
[source,xml]
----
<connectorConfiguration>
    <configurationProperties>
        ...
        <auxiliaryObjectClasses>user:posixAccount</auxiliaryObjectClasses>
        ...
    </configurationProperties>
</connectorConfiguration>
----

What the value `user:posixAccount` represents:

* `user` is the name of the structural object class
* `:` delimiter between the name of the structural object class and auxiliary object classes
* `posixAccount` is the name of the auxiliary object class
* Any number of additional auxiliary object classes may be added to the value by using the delimiter `,` between the names of the auxiliary object classes
