= Active Directory Connector (LDAP)

== Capabilities and Features

// Later: This will be moved to individual connector version page (automatically generated)
// Maybe we want to keep summary of the latest version here

[%autowidth,cols="h,1,1"]
|===
| Schema | YES | Determined from standard LDAP schema, experimental support for native AD schema.

| Provisioning
| YES
|

| Live Synchronization
| YES
| Active Directory DirSync synchronization supported.^1)^

| Password
| YES
|

| Activation
| YES
| Activation using the userAccountControl attribute.

| Paging support
| YES
| Simple Paged Results and VLV

| Native attribute names
| YES
| Use `ri:dn` instead of `icfs:name`.
Use `ri:GUID` instead of `icfs:uid`.

| Scripting
| NO
| Use of dedicated scripting connectors (SSH, PowerHell) is recommended.

|===

1) For the DirSync synchronization the *DS-Replication-Get-Changes* ( 1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2 ) extended right has to be granted.

== Interoperability

Following versions of Active Directory are supported:

* Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Windows Server 2022
* Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Windows Server 2019

Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) or any other variants of Active Directory or related services are NOT supported.

The connector supports only a subset of the operations that are available by using LDAP protocol and at the same time are documented in public Microsoft documentation.
The connector does *not* claim to support all AD operations and complete AD functionality.
Basic provisioning functionality is supported and it is tested in numerous real-world deployments.
But advanced functionality may not be supported at all.
Active Directory is a complex, proprietary and heavily non-standard system.
It is not possible for the connector to support all the available operations.
We recommend conducting a feasibility testing before deploying this connector.
In case some connector functionality is missing then we recommend to purchase xref:/support/subscription-sponsoring/[midPoint platform subscription] to cover the functionality gap.

.Unsupported Active Directory Versions
[NOTE]
====
Following Active Directory versions (including their variants) are no longer supported, as they are not covered by regular (mainstream) support from Microsoft:

* Active Directory 2016
* Active Directory 2012, including 2012R2
* Active Directory 2008, including 2008R2

Please see xref:/support/connected-systems.adoc[Evolveum support policy details].
====

=== Known Limitations

* Synchronization based on modifyTimestamp has a simplistic implementation.
It does not support SPR, VLV or referral-following functionality.
This synchronization method is inherently inefficient and unreliable.
It should be used only as a last resort, if no other method is available.
Active Directory DirSync method should be preferred whenever available.

* Minimal xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/#fetch-strategy[fetch strategy] does not work reliably.
LDAP has no way to specify that the connector wants to fetch all regular attributes except for one.
Therefore, the connector has to list all the other attributes of an object, except the one expensive attribute (such as `jpegPhoto` or `member`).
However, Active Directory has attributes that cannot be used it a regular (subtree) search.
If the list of attributes happen to contain such an "unsearchable" attribute, the request fails.
Even worse, AD is not exposing information about search limitations in standard LDAP schema.
Therefore, this LDAP-based connector has no way to find out which attributes are not searchable.
+
A symptom of this problem is usually an error: `00002120: SvcErr: DSID-......., problem 5012` a.k.a. `ERROR_DS_NON_BASE_SEARCH`.
+
Possible solution is to use non-standard schema definition data structures which are native to Active Directory.
However, this code is not production-ready yet.

* LDAP connector 3.4 introduced a fail-over mechanism for LDAP servers.
However, this mechanism is designed for standard-compliant LDAP server (which AD is not), and it was not tested with Active Directory.
Therefore, the fail-over mechanism is *not supported* for Active Directory.

* Newer version of AD may not support VLV paging strategy (recognized on Win2022).
In case of higher amount of the objects the "Fatal error" is shown under *Resource objects* listing.
+
A symptom of this problem is usually an error: `000020EF: SvcErr: DSID-........, problem 5010 (UNAVAIL_EXTENSION)`.
+
In case you are facing this issue the solution would be setting *pagingStrategy* to *spr*.

* Native associations supported only for the subject to object direction, i.e. the 'memberOf' attribute
residing in the subject object class is being evaluated each time. Only one object-object type is supported per subject-object type association attribute
(i.e. only 'group' type of object DN's will be present in the 'member' attribute ), LiveSync is not capable
of directly detecting native association events, and the connector does not handle 'primary groups' as a part of
the entitlements managed by the native association handling.

=== MS Exchange Interoperability

Technically, this connector can be used to provision Microsoft Exchange servers in an indirect way by using PowerShell scripts.

Firstly, the Exchange attributes are accessible in Active Directory when the Exchange software is installed.
The AD/LDAP connector dynamically discovers AD schema and therefore it will discover presence of these attributes.
Then these attributes can be manipulated in a normal way.
Please note that some Exchange attributes may not be properly propagated in the AD LDAP schema.
In such case there is a workaround to specify these attributes in the `operationalAttributes` connector configuration property.

Secondly, since version 1.4.2.18 the connector had support to execute commands and powershell scripts remotely using the WinRM interface.
This feature can be used to manage Exchange mailboxes and additional settings.
This feature was later "separated" to a dedicated PowerShell scripting connector.
Please see xref:/connectors/resources/active-directory/powershell/[Powershell Support in AD/LDAP Connector] page for more details.

However, support for MS Exchange is *not*  included in the "bundled" support for this connector (see below).

|===

fixes handling of __ENABLE__ attribute

This connector is based on the xref:../com.evolveum.polygon.connector.ldap.LdapConnector/[LDAP Connector] which was completely rewritten from scratch during 2015-2016.

== Support

This connector is bundled with midPoint distribution.
Support for LDAP connector is included in standard midPoint support service (a.k.a xref:/support/bundled-support/[bundled support]) - however, there are limitations:

* Only some Active Directory versions are supported (see above)

* Only some Active Directory features are supported (see above).
The connector *does not claim to be feature-complete*. We recommend conducting a feasibility testing before deploying this connector.
In case some connector functionality is missing then we recommend to purchase xref:/support/subscription-sponsoring/[midPoint platform subscription] to cover the functionality gap.

* PowerShell scripting implemented in this connector is supposed to be used to supplement creation of Active Directory (windows) accounts by using simple scripts.
It is not supposed to be used to manage Microsoft Exchange accounts.
Management of Exchange accounts can be quite a complex matter, requiring complicated PowerShell scripts.
Support for the use of this connector to manage Exchange accounts has to be purchased separately.

[TIP]
====
There may be exception to this rule for the customers that purchased support before the release of midPoint 4.0. In case of any doubts please contact Evolveum sales representatives.
====

When dealing with connector issues, please make sure to follow xref:../com.evolveum.polygon.connector.ldap.LdapConnector/troubleshooting/[LDAP Connector Troubleshooting Guide].

== Licensing

The connector itself is available under the terms of Apache License 2.0. The connector is using only the LDAP protocol to access Active Directory.
We are not using any Microsoft library or any other component that might be subject to Microsoft licensing.
To our best knowledge no extra license is needed to use the connector with Active Directory.
However the Microsoft license texts are not entirely clear and we are not lawyers.
Therefore it is recommended for each user to make his own analysis of the licensing issues.
Please use your Microsoft support program and contact Microsoft with the licensing question when in doubt.

== Notes

This connector is contained in LDAP connector bundle, which also contains LDAP connector.
Both connectors are specializations of the LDAP connectors.
The Active Directory connector has additional support for the LDAP quirks needed to work with AD.

=== ConnId Result Handlers

[WARNING]
====
We strongly recommend to disable all the handlers when working with well-designed connectors in general and when working with our LDAP or xref:/connectors/connectors/com.evolveum.polygon.connector.ldap.ad.AdLdapConnector/[AD/LDAP] connectors in particular.
====

Those "result handlers" are an artifact of an original xref:/connectors/connid/1.x/icf-issues/[original Identity Connector Framework over-engineering]. The handlers are supposed to assist connectors by implementing "mechanism" that the connector or resource does not support - such as search result filtering, data normalization and so on.
However, those handler are generic and they know nothing about the particulars of the resource that the connector connects to.
Therefore in vast majority of cases those handlers just get into the way and they distort the data.
Good connectors usually do not need those handlers at all.
Unfortunately, these handler are enabled by default and there is no way for a connector to tell the framework to turn them off.
The handlers needs to be explicitly disabled in the resource configuration.

[source,xml]
----
<icfs:resultsHandlerConfiguration>
  <icfs:enableNormalizingResultsHandler>false</icfs:enableNormalizingResultsHandler>
  <icfs:enableFilteredResultsHandler>false</icfs:enableFilteredResultsHandler>
  <icfs:enableAttributesToGetSearchResultsHandler>false</icfs:enableAttributesToGetSearchResultsHandler>
</icfs:resultsHandlerConfiguration>
----

=== ObjectClass Filters

Natural way to use LDAP is to use "short" search filters, such as `(cn=foo)`. However, such search filter can match objects of several incompatible objectclasses, producing incorrect results.
Therefore a strict way to construct a search filter is to always add an objectclass clause to the filter, resulting in `(&(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)(cn=foo))` filter.
Use of such search filter ensures that the results will be correct.

This search filter should work flawlessly on standard-compliance and correctly-configured LDAP servers.
Therefore since connector version 3.2, use of such search filters is tuned on by default.
However, such search filters may cause issues on non-compliant and/or incorrectly configured and populated servers.
In such case, the behavior can be controlled by `includeObjectClassFilter` configuration property.

[#_native_associations]
=== Native Associations

Starting from the connector version 3.8 the LDAP connector is capable of constructing reference attributes that describe the relation between resource objects.
By providing this information to the IAM client the connector supports the native association capability.
This behavior is governed by the `managedAssociationPairs` multivalued attribute.
The input for this attribute is a string following a convention.
Based on this information the connector is capable of figuring out which object classes have a relation between each other and also which parameters should be used for such relation.

[#_example_m_association_pairs_one]
[source,xml]
----
    <connectorConfiguration>
        <configurationProperties>
            <host>primary.ldap.example.com</host>
            <baseContext>dc=evolveum,dc=com</baseContext>
            <managedAssociationPairs>"user"+memberOf -# "group"+member</managedAssociationPairs>
            ...
        </configurationProperties>
    </connectorConfiguration>
----

The attribute value, in our case `"user"+memberOf -# "group"+member`,
has the following convention `"Subject objectClass name"+Subject attribute -# "Object objectClass name" + Object attribute`.

[#_note_subject_object]
[NOTE]
====
*Subject and Object*

The words "subject" and "object" are being used in this and the xref:#_schema_for_native_associations[Schema for Native Associations] section.

* *Subject*, is the type of resource object which receives an entitlement, i.e. an "account".
* *Object*, is the type of resource object which represent an entitlement, i.e. a "group".

The Subject and Object in our context have a relation between each other (i.e. subject being a member of a group).

More information about this topic can be found in our document about xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/entitlements/[Entitlements and Associations].
====

* "Subject objectClass name", being the object class representing the "Subject" of this association.
* "Subject attribute", being the attribute containing a list of entitlements of the subject (i.e. group of which an account is a member of).
* "Object objectClass name", being the object class representing the "Object" of this association.
* "Object attribute", which is the attribute containing a list of the members of an object.

By using the above mentioned example, the connector will manage the relations between the object class `user`
and the object class `group` based on the values present in the parameters `memberOf` (for `user`) and `member` (for `group`).

This being a multivalued attribute means that you are capable of specifying multiple pairs of object types, having the relation
between them marked as managed by the connector.

[source,xml]

    <connectorConfiguration>
        <configurationProperties>
            ...
            <managedAssociationPairs>"user"+memberOf -# "group"+member</managedAssociationPairs>
            <managedAssociationPairs>"group"+memberOf -# "group"+member</managedAssociationPairs>
            ...
        </configurationProperties>
    </connectorConfiguration>

The addition of this parameter will signal to the connector that it should use the native association handling,
this also changes the way how the schema is generated by the connector.
Regarding this please see xref:#_schema_for_native_associations[Schema for Native Associations].

If using "Operational Attributes" in the value for the `managedAssociationPairs` configuration property,
please also specify these attributes in the `operationalAttributes` configuration property.
As we can see in the xref:#_example_m_association_pairs_one[example] above.

When using an "Object" object class (i.e. groupOfNames) which is extended via an "Auxiliary" object class (usually not the case), please also add the
`auxiliaryObjectClasses` configuration property to your resource configuration, and specify the auxiliary object classes witch are used.

This feature also has some limitation, please see the xref:#_limitations[Limitations] section.

[#_schema_for_native_associations]
=== Schema for Native Associations

One of the outcomes of the setting up of the configuration for xref:#_native_associations[Native Associations],
is that some changes will be done also to the schema. If you are setting up the connector for the first time this
should not concern you, yet if you are familiar with the original schema the following lines might be interesting.

Please see this xref:#_note_subject_object[Note].

The attributes originally used in the association i.e. `memberOf` and `member` will no longer be present in the schema.
The "subject" object class attribute i.e. `memberOf` will be replaced by the attribute `group`,
the "object" object class attribute will be replaced by an attribute (with a similar name) `member`.
A "custom" type and some additional schema parameters are generated for such attributes.
The new `member` attribute is marked as "not readable" and "not returned" by default, the fetch of this attribute is not currently supported.

If you already have a schema generated before the xref:#_native_associations[Native Associations] configuration has been set up,
you have to refresh the connector schema.
