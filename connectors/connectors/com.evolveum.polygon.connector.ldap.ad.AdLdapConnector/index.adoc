|===


== Interoperability

Following versions of Active Directory are supported:

* Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Windows Server 2012R2, 2019

Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) or any other variants of Active Directory or related services are NOT supported.

The connector supports only a subset of the operations that are available by using LDAP protocol and at the same time are documented in public Microsoft documentation.
The connector does *not* claim to support all AD operations and complete AD functionality.
Basic provisioning functionality is supported and it is tested in numerous real-world deployments.
But advanced functionality may not be supported at all.
Active Directory is a complex, proprietary and heavily non-standard system.
It is not possible for the connector to support all the available operations.
We recommend to conduct a feasibility testing before deploying this connector.
In case some connector functionality is missing then we recommend to purchase wiki:Subscriptions+and+Sponsoring[midPoint platform subscription] to cover the functionality gap.

[NOTE]
====
Active Directory 2008 and any of its variants (2008R2) are no longer supported for any new midPoint deployments.
Those AD servers may be supported under some circumstances for customers that purchased midPoint subscription before release of midPoint 4.0.2. Please contact Evolveum sales for the details.
====

=== Limitations

* Synchronization based on modifyTimestamp has a simplistic implementation.
It does not support SPR, VLV or referral-following functionality.
This synchronization method is inherently inefficient and unreliable.
It should be used only as a last resort, if no other method is available.
Active Directory DirSync method should be preferred whenever available.

=== MS Exchange Interoperability

Technically, this connector can be used to provision Microsoft Exchange servers in an indirect way by using PowerShell scripts.

Firstly, the Exchange attributes are accessible in Active Directory when the Exchange software is installed.
The AD/LDAP connector dynamically discovers AD schema and therefore it will discover presence of these attributes.
Then these attributes can be manipulated in a normal way.
Please note that some Exchange attributes may not be properly propagated in the AD LDAP schema.
In such case there is a workaround to specify these attributes in the `operationalAttributes` connector configuration property.

Secondly, since version 1.4.2.18 the connector had support to execute commands and powershell scripts remotely using the WinRM interface.
This feature can be used to manage Exchange mailboxes and additional settings.
This feature was later "separated" to a dedicated PowerShell scripting connector.
Please see wiki:Powershell+Support+in+AD/LDAP+Connector[Powershell Support in AD/LDAP Connector] page for more details.

However, support for MS Exchange is *not*  included in the "bundled" support for this connector (see below).

== History

// This is temporary, we want to replace it with auto-generated (or semi-auto-generated) pages.

|===

This connector is based on the xref:../com.evolveum.polygon.connector.ldap.LdapConnector/[LDAP Connector] which was completely rewritten from scratch during 2015-2016.

== Support

This connector is bundled with midPoint distribution.
Support for LDAP connector is included in standard midPoint support service (a.k.a wiki:Bundled+Support[bundled support]) - however, there are limitations:

* Only some Active Directory versions are supported (see above)

* Only some Active Directory features are supported (see above).
The connector *does not claim to be feature-complete*. We recommend conducting a feasibility testing before deploying this connector.
In case some connector functionality is missing then we recommend to purchase wiki:Subscriptions+and+Sponsoring[midPoint platform subscription] to cover the functionality gap.

* PowerShell scripting implemented in this connector is supposed to be used to supplement creation of Active Directory (windows) accounts by using simple scripts.
It is not supposed to be used to manage Microsoft Exchange accounts.
Management of Exchange accounts can be quite a complex matter, requiring complicated PowerShell scripts.
Support for the use of this connector to manage Exchange accounts has to be purchased separately.

[TIP]
====
There may be exception to this rule for the customers that purchased support before the release of midPoint 4.0. In case of any doubts please contact Evolveum sales representatives.
====

When dealing with connector issues, please make sure to follow xref:../com.evolveum.polygon.connector.ldap.LdapConnector/troubleshooting/[LDAP Connector Troubleshooting Guide].

== Licensing

The connector itself is available under the terms of Apache License 2.0. The connector is using only the LDAP protocol to access Active Directory.
We are not using any Microsoft library or any other component that might be subject to Microsoft licensing.
To our best knowledge no extra license is needed to use the connector with Active Directory.
However the Microsoft license texts are not entirely clear and we are not lawyers.
Therefore it is recommended for each user to make his own analysis of the licensing issues.
Please use your Microsoft support program and contact Microsoft with the licensing question when in doubt.

== Notes

This connector is contained in LDAP connector bundle, which also contains LDAP connector.
Both connectors are specializations of the LDAP connectors.
The Active Directory connector has additional support for the LDAP quirks needed to work with AD.

=== ConnId Result Handlers

[WARNING]
====
We strongly recommend to disable all the handlers when working with well-designed connectors in general and when working with our LDAP or wiki:Active+Directory+Connector+(LDAP)[AD/LDAP] connectors in particular.
====

Those "result handlers" are an artifact of an original wiki:ICF+Issues[original Identity Connector Framework over-engineering]. The handlers are supposed to assist connectors by implementing "mechanism" that the connector or resource does not support - such as search result filtering, data normalization and so on.
However, those handler are generic and they know nothing about the particulars of the resource that the connector connects to.
Therefore in vast majority of cases those handlers just get into the way and they distort the data.
Good connectors usually do not need those handlers at all.
Unfortunately, these handler are enabled by default and there is no way for a connector to tell the framework to turn them off.
The handlers needs to be explicitly disabled in the resource configuration.

<icfs:resultsHandlerConfiguration>
  <icfs:enableNormalizingResultsHandler>false</icfs:enableNormalizingResultsHandler>
  <icfs:enableFilteredResultsHandler>false</icfs:enableFilteredResultsHandler>
  <icfs:enableAttributesToGetSearchResultsHandler>false</icfs:enableAttributesToGetSearchResultsHandler>
</icfs:resultsHandlerConfiguration>
----

=== ObjectClass Filters

Natural way to use LDAP is to use "short" search filters, such as `(cn=foo)`. However, such search filter can match objects of several incompatible objectclasses, producing incorrect results.
Therefore a strict way to construct a search filter is to always add an objectclass clause to the filter, resulting in `(&(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)(cn=foo))` filter.
Use of such search filter ensures that the results will be correct.

This search filter should work flawlessly on standard-compliance and correctly-configured LDAP servers.
Therefore since connector version 3.2, use of such search filters is tuned on by default.
However, such search filters may cause issues on non-compliant and/or incorrectly configured and populated servers.
In such case, the behavior can be controlled by `includeObjectClassFilter` configuration property.
