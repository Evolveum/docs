[WARNING]
.Legacy, unsupported
====
This connector was part of LDAP bundle for many years.
However, there is no demand for this connector among midPoint subscribers.
Therefore this connector is considered to be a legacy and was removed from LDAP bundle.
====

This connector is an eDirectory-specific extension of our LDAP connector.
It contains, among others, support for the following attributes:

* user (inetOrgPerson) attributes: groupMembership and securityEquals for maintaining referential integrity

* group (nestedGroupAux) attributes: equivalentToMe and member

Based on Apache Directory API.
Apache-licensed.

== Documentation

Be advised there are multiple interesting limitations within the eDirectory (not midPoint):

* CN attribute has a maximum size of 64 characters

* subsequent white spaces (e.g. spaces) and underscores in the attribute values are considered to be the same as single space, so the following objects are considered to be the same and cannot be created simultaneously:

** "cn=this is a space,ou=people,o=example"

** "cn=this   is      a     space,ou=people,o=example"

** "cn=this is a space ,ou=people,o=example"

** "cn=this_is_a_space,ou=people,o=example"

** "cn=pass:[___this___is___a___space],ou=people,o=example"


* searching for values with whitespace e.g. pass:["cn=a__b________c"] may actually return object "cn=a b c,ou=people,o=example".
