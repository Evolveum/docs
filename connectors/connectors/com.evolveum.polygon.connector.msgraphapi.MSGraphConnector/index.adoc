== Documentation


=== Introduction

TODO


=== Limitations

Currently three object types are supported by the connector. Accounts, groups and licence objects.
There are some limitations in case of more complex relationship parameters (i.e. "App role assignments" in regards of the User
type objects), which are not present in the schema because of the current connID API limitations.
The group objects "distribution lists" and "mail and security" groups are read-only due to graph API limitations. General
provisioning and deprovisioning of group objects is otherwise permitted. Licences objects access is possible and read-only.
Role object class is currently implemented as read only, except role membership management.

Only basic query features are supported fo Licence and Role objects.

== Supporter filters for Licence and Role Objects (other than all filter)

[%autowidth]
|===
| ObjectClass | Parameters | Filter | Note

| Role
| Uid, Display Name
| Equals Filter
|

| Role
| Display Name
| Contains Filter
| Contains filter will be translated to "Starts With" filter

| Role
|
| Contains All Values
|


| Licence
| Uid, Id
| Equals Filter

|===

[WARNING]
====
Past usage of the API permitted the update of membership information regarding "distribution lists"
and "mail and security" groups objects. This seems to have changed in a future version of the
graph API referencing this as a bug.

link: https://github.com/microsoftgraph/microsoft-graph-docs/issues/14899[Microsoft documentation bug report]
====

Query url construction for Accounts and Groups now gives the possibility to specify complex queries using
Composite filters (‘And’, ‘Or’) and also ‘Not’ filter. There are a couple of api limitations in the
usage of filters.


- Contains filter: Although the graph API documentation states that a contains filter functionality
is provided, in reality the usage is quite limited.
To compensate for this, the connector leverages the “search” functionality which in some cases can
partially work as a ‘contains’ filter (tokens).
Please see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/search-query-parameter[Use the $search query parameter in Microsoft Graph APIs].
- Less than, Greater than filter: The construction of the filter queries is implemented properly
yet the API responds mostly with an exception hinting that “Less than or equals” or “Greater
than or equals” filtering should be used instead (did not find the reason for this in the API
documentation yet).
- Not and Ends with filter have implicitly the “count” parameter set to true.
This is requested by the API, please see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/aad-advanced-queries[Advanced query capabilities on Microsoft Entra ID objects].
- Generally you might experience specific limitations for other attributes. Usually you will be prompted with a corresponding exception.


When using a query which has a “contains” filter with other types of filter preset
(Other than composite filters or the ‘NOT’ filter). The part of the query with the contains filter
(either the single contains or other composite filter or not filter with only contains filters) has
to be directly on the left or right side of the first ‘AND’ filter clause. This is due to API limitations
regarding the combination of the ‘filter’ and ‘search’ clause, please see
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/search-query-parameter[Use the $search query parameter in Microsoft Graph APIs].

Please also keep in mind the way you structure the queries related to this fact. MidPoint will automatically generate some parts
of the ‘AND’ filter tree based on the notation used in your configuration. In case of the usage of ‘Contains’ filter, please divide the ‘AND’ clauses directly in the configuration.
Please see the example below:

[source]
----
(attributes/icfs:name not startsWith "XYZ" and attributes/icfs:name not endsWith "Baar")
and ((attributes/ri:department not contains "FOO" and attributes/ri:department not contains "Baar")
and (attributes/icfs:name contains "A" or attributes/icfs:name contains "B"))
----

== Notes

The following ssl certificates are need for the connector deployment:
[source]
----
DigiCert Global Root CA
DigiCert Global Root G2
----

With the version 'version' 1.1.0.0 of the connector, the discovery method automatically fetches the
jvm default trust store which holds the early mentioned certificates by default. The discovery method
offers to use this trust store for communication.

Some API resources might have a limit on the amount of API calls. This called 'resource throttling'
might have an effect on the general performance of the connector.
The connector itself copes with this by invoking the request for a specific resource multiple times
(if needed) with a pause between each attempt. The length of the 'wait time' depends on the reply
from the API endpoint, which provides the connector with the information about the availability of
the endpoint. For more information see "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/throttling".

== Setup
* Import of SSL certificates into midPoint keystore, see notes above. (Configuration discovery might suggest the system keystore for the connector if the certificates are not present in midPoint keystore)
* Create your application in Entra ID (former Azure Active Directory), for more information how to create it please see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-identity-manager/microsoft-identity-manager-2016-connector-graph.
* Add all DELEGATED permissions, see below.

== Permissions

This are the permissions which you need to add to your Entra ID (former Azure Active Directory) instance for midPoint:

*Required*

*  Directory.Read.All
*  Directory.ReadWrite.All
*  Group.Create
*  Group.Read.All
*  Group.ReadWrite.All
*  Group.Selected
*  GroupMember.Read.All
*  GroupMember.ReadWrite.All
*  PrivilegedAccess.Read.AzureADGroup
*  PrivilegedAccess.ReadWrite.AzureADGroup
*  User.Read.All
*  User.ReadWrite.All

*Optional: Role Membership Management*

[NOTE]
====
Additionally, to Licences and Groups Microsoft Entra also provides Roles as an object representing an entitlement.
If you want to manage the Role object class you will need some additional permissions.
====

*  EntitlementManagement.Read.All
*  EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All
*  RoleManagement.Read.Directory
*  RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory
