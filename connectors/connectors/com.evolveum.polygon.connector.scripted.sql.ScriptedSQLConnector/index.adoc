The connector can be described as a "wrapper" for scripts (e.g. Groovy) where custom scripts provide implementation of the operations (Create, Update, Delete etc.)

== History

This connector was originally developed in OpenICF project.
This version of the connector was heavily updated during 2018.
Scripts used with wiki:ScriptedSQL+Connector+(deprecated)[ScriptedSQL Connector (deprecated)] have to be modified.

Connector history continues in the spring of 2019, when Evolveum adopted the connector.
Additional fixes were provided and connector architecture changed to PoolableConnector.
Poolable connector let midPoint decide over the connection objects life cycle rather than relying on deprecated tomcat7 connection pool (which was replaced).
As a consequence of this change, *parameters from previous connector version are not compatible with new poolable connector* as connection data source changed.
However migration is fairly easy, just make sure at least following resource parameters are set (on top of providing usual script file names for groovy part of the connector):

[%autowidth]
|===
| Parameter | Example value

| jdbcDriver
| com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver

| jdbcUrlTemplate
| jdbc:link:sqlserver://w5pega01.oskarmobil.cz\\PInterface:1433[sqlserver://localhost\\DBInterface:1433]

| user
| midpoint

| password
| *****

|===

Connection Validation Query parameter was dropped since checkAlive method uses less costly methods to validate connection pulled from the pool.

== Logging

Use implicit log variable in your resource script as follows:

[source]
----
log.info("Entering " + operation + " Script")
----

Turn on midPoint logging for specific script file name.
For instance for SearchScript.groovy use:
