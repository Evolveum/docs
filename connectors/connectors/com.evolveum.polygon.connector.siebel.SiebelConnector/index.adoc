Oracle Siebel Connector for midPoint is community developed connector that manages user accounts in Siebel user management.

[WARNING]
.Some code changes may be needed before connector deployment!
====
This connector is using native Siebel WS.
However, account data model exposed to IdM was configured on Siebel side to match particular deployment. +
Connector was developed and tested with single customer with Siebel web services exposed at 3rd party middleware layer.
====

Siebel connector was introduced as a contribution to midPoint project by link:http://www.ami.cz/en/[AMI Praha] and is not officially supported by Evolveum.

Siebel connector contains support for ACCOUNT entity type only.

== Overview

=== Supported Operations

The Siebel connector supports the following operations:

* Create

* Get

* Schema

* Paged Search

* Test

* Update

* Activation

Connector does not support delete operation, consider using xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/activation/disable-instead-of-delete/[disable instead].


=== Configuration

The following table lists all the configuration properties you can specify when setting up the Siebel connector:


[%autowidth]
|===
| Configuration Property | Required | Type | Example | Description

| WS URL
| X
| String
|
|

| WS username
| X
| String
|
|

| WS password
| X
| String

| int
| 100
| Default page size used when explicit setting is not provided (e.g. during reconciliation task)

| Connection timeout
| X
| int
| 60000
| Timeout in [ms] to establish HTTP connection

| Receive timeout
| X
| int
| 600000
| Timeout in [ms] to retrieve data from single WS call.
Should be set high enough for Search All operation to finish.

| Basedir of SOAP log files

| Enter path to the file system directory, if detailed SOAP logging is to be enabled.
Leave empty to disable SOAP logging.

=== Getting started

==== Building the connector

link:https://github.com/Evolveum/connector-siebel[Download] and build the project with usual:

[source]
----
mvn clean install
----

Import connector JAR file to one of these locations:

* icf-connectors directory in midPoint home (recommended)

* midPoint WEB-INF/lib

* application server (e.g. Tomcat) lib directory


==== Creating resource

Sample resource XML can be found on link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/blob/master/samples/resources/siebel/siebel-resource.xml[midPoint GitHub].


==== Changing the interface

As stated in the beginning, some code changes may be necessary, here are some tips:

* Connector is using wsdl2java component to generate interface classes at the build time.

* Connector comes with predefined WSDLs (src\main\resources\wsdl\) that may NOT fit your actual Siebel deployment.

* By changing the WSDL files, adapting connector and possibly fixing or disabling automated tests you may create your own Siebel connector.

* Of course, if you dont wish to do that, you can make your Siebel to adjust to data model described in connector WSDLs.
Good luck â˜º


=== Advanced business logic

Siebel is complex system and managing some account attributes is not always easy.
Here are some tips regarding sample connector:

* In Siebel's data model, some values are more important then the other.
These are marked as "primary" and connector supports that behaviour via proper attribute naming.

* Related positions (PrimaryPosition, SecondaryPositions) are identified with IDs, not names.

* When creating Siebel roles definition, you may be interested in xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/rbac/radio-button-roles/[Radio Button Roles] so you can e.g. replace jobtitle value when new role assignment is approved in midPoint.

* When approving role assignment, your Siebel admin may enter some resource attribute values manually (e.g. primary position) using midPoint's xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/custom-forms/[forms]. (also look for approvalSchema-level-formRef)
