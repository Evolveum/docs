== Licensing

The connector itself is available under the terms of Apache License 2.0. To our best knowledge, there is no extra license needed to use this connector.

== Documentation

To generate Your SmartRecruiters API key please log in, go to Settings / Admin, find in Configuration section link:https://www.smartrecruiters.com/settings/configuration/api-integrations[API / Integrations].

Smart recruiters use Email globally, so if one e-mail address is registered and active, you can't create the new user with same e-mail address over API.
If you need to have test and also production environment, please use some e-mail address obfuscation like:

----
email = emailAddress.replace('@', '_');
return 'yourGmailAccount+' + email + '@gmail.com';
----

At the same time, in SmartRecruiters one user has exactly one role assigned.
Connector solve this restriction automatically - find the strongest role from list of all roles what midPoint sent and set only this.
