This connector is useful to connect to systems that regularly export or import user databases in a form of CSV files.
It is usually used to connect to HR-like systems that export the HR data every night.
MidPoint deployments are usually using this connector to pull that data.
This connector pretends that the CSV file is actually the complete resource.
Therefore the usual configuration of an authoritative resource can be used to connect such an export-based resource.

[WARNING]
.Obsolete
====
*This connector is a development dead-end.* It was written even before midPoint project started and it was not designed for real deployment use.
We have maintained and improved the connector during the years.
But it is very difficult to maintain.
Also the ConnId framework evolved over the time and we needed a connector that will use these features.
Therefore we have decided to rewrite the connector completely.
Next generation xref:../com.evolveum.polygon.connector.csv.CsvConnector/[CSV Connector] is in development and it was finished in early 2017.
Please use that connector instead.
The old CSVFile connector is no longer supported. +
====

This connector can also be used as a remote connector if the file is on a different machine than midPoint.
