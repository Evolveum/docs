= SCIM2 Connector

== Supported systems

All systems compatible with SCIM2 protocol are supported.

Nevertheless, some systems are not implementing SCIM2 fully or have custom extensions that are necessary for managing identities in them.
Therefore, the connector have additional built-in support for following systems which are not fully SCIM2 compliant:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Slack
