= MongoDB Connector

MongoDB connector for midPoint IDM.

== Capabilities and Features

[%autowidth,cols="h,1,1"]
|===
| Schema | YES | Dynamic
| Provisioning | YES |
| Live Synchronization | YES |
| Password | YES |
| Activation | YES | Simulated
| Script execution | NO |
|===

== Dynamic Schema

The connector uses a dynamic schema based on the templateUser document. This template defines all attributes and their data types, serving as the foundation for the ICF ConnId schema.

*Important:* templateUser should be protected to avoid accidental overwrite, or made read-only.

=== Key Points

*Required Template:* The templateUser must define all attributes to be processed by the connector.

*Attribute Types:* Each attribute must have a defined type (e.g., String, Boolean, Integer, or List for multivalued attributes).

*Multivalued Attributes:* Only one-dimensional arrays with elements of the same type are supported.

== MongoDB Database Configuration

keyColumn represents `icfs:name`.

`MongoDB _id` is represented by `icfs:uid`.

=== Supported Attributes/Data Types

|===
| Feature               | Supported                                   | Example
| Array Depth           | Depth of 1 (One-dimensional arrays)         | ["val1", "val2", "val3"]
| Nested Arrays         | Not supported                               | [["val1a", "val1b"], ["val2a", "val2b"]]
| Data Types            | Supported                                   | String, Boolean, Integer
| Maps (Key-Value Pairs) | Not supported                               | { "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" }
|===

== Database Setup

. Create Database -> Create Collection -> Create systemUser.
. In the collection, create templateUser, which the connector uses to create the schema. Ensure that your template user has all fields populated with appropriate data. Null values in the database are treated as String data type.
. In connectorConfiguration, define keyColumn which will represent shadow's icfs:name attribute, for example: username.
. In the database, create an index for the attribute specified in step 3. This is crucial; otherwise, the connector won't be able to determine if an account is present in the database.

== LiveSync

Configurable through the connector configuration property liveSyncAttributeName. In MongoDB, it must be defined as ISODate.

== JavaDoc

JavaDoc can be generated locally with this command:

[source, bash]
----
mvn clean javadoc:javadoc
----

== Build

[source, bash]
----
mvn clean install
----

== Build Without Tests

[source, bash]
----
mvn clean install -DskipTests=True
----

After a successful build, you can find connector-mongodb-+{+**versionNumber**+}+.jar in the target directory.
