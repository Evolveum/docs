== Capabilities and Features

[%autowidth,cols="h,1,1"]
|===
| Schema
| YES
| Full Odoo schema is accessible. As this schema can be quite complex, we recommend to set some wildcard filters in the connector configuration to limit schema observation to hr.* for hr elements and only a few needed Odoo packages.

| Provisioning
| YES
| All Odoo entity types can be provisioned.

| Live Synchronization
| EXPLICIT
| Canâ€™t receive change notifications from Odoo directly, so the synchronization has to be explicit.

| Password
| YES
| Passwords can be synchronized both ways.

| Activation
| YES
| Activation status can be mapped.
