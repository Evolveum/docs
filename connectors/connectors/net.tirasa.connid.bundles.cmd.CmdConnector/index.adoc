== Capabilities and Features

The connector can be described as a "wrapper" for scripts (e.g. shell) which are the actual implementation of the operations (Create, Update, Delete etc.). If the scripts should be executed on different machine, you need to use wiki:Connector+Server[Connector Server]

// Later: This will be moved to individual connector version page (automatically generated)
// Maybe we want to keep summary of the latest version here
