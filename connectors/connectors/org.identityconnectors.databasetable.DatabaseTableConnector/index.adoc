|===


== Interoperability

This connector is supposed to work with all relational databases that follow the SQL standard and that provide a JDBC driver.
The driver is *not*  part of the connector distribution (except for PostgreSQL driver, which is distributed with midPoint).
The deployer is responsible for using correct JDBC driver.

== Limitations

The connector supports only a single database table.

Requires correct JDBC driver to be present on classpath


== Support

Only standard SQL behavior is supported.
This means standard SQL operations and standard database schemas.
Non-standard database operations and vendor-specific behavior is not supported.

Problems originating in JDBC driver, problem that are caused by non-compliance to SQL standard or vendor-specific behavior are *not*  covered by the support.

The xref:/support/bundled-support/[bundled support] does not include support for any specific database server.
Support for specific database servers needs to be explicitly negotiated in the support contract.


== Documentation

Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive documentation for this connector.


== Resource Examples

* xref:/connectors/resources/databasetable/[DatabaseTable]


== Notes

DatabaseTable connector now assumes that UID is the same as NAME.
See bug:MID-1127[].

The following two configuration properties were reported to resolve problems with Oracle DATE attribute

[source]
----
<icfsdbt:nativeTimestamps>true</icfsdbt:nativeTimestamps>
<icfsdbt:allNative>true</icfsdbt:allNative>
----

For PostgreSQL TIMESTAMP or TIMESTAMPTZ attribute only allNative configuration property is needed

[source]
----
<icfsdbt:allNative>true</icfsdbt:allNative>
----

In addition, the DATE, TIMESTAMP or TIMESTAMPTZ column must be provisioned as string with correct formatting, e.g.: `return new Date().format("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")`, otherwise "ORA-01861: literal does not match format string" occurs (or similar exception in PostreSQL).


TIMESTAMPTZ is stored including the timezone.
DatabaseTable connector doesn't work with timezone directly, but the value is automatically converted to midPoint local timezone.
Therefore, you always work with local timezone in mappings and it will be automatically stored correctly in the database.


PostgreSQL server might be configured to close the idle connection after several minutes.
That will raise following exception in the DatabaseTable connector "DB error: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException(An I/O error occurred while sending to the backend.)->;java.net.SocketException(Connection reset)".
Solution for this problem is to configure JDBC driver to send keepalive packets by adding `keepalives=1` and `keepalives_idle=XXX` (XXX is number of seconds after which keepalive packet will be sent) to `jdbcUrlTemplate`.
For example:

[source]
----
<icfsdbt:jdbcUrlTemplate>jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/databaseName?keepalives=1&keepalives_idle=120</icfsdbt:jdbcUrlTemplate>
----

SQLStateExceptionHandling configuration parameter was added. This acts as a switch if SqlState flag based exception evaluation should be turned on. Currently the evaluation helps to translate SQL error messages to the "AlreadyExists" exception for further handling on the IAM. By default the flag is set to "false". In case that the default behavior is active then other mechanisms of exception interpretation are active (i.e. see "Already exists messages" configuration property).

As from the connector version 1.4.9.0 the SQLStateExceptionHandling is extended by the capability of specifying concrete sqlState codes for some of the most frequent exceptions. The properties used for this are mutlivalued so you are capable to interpret multiple sqlState codes in case of an error. SQLState codes are an SQL standard and should be present in the documentation of most of the relational databases. The debug log also dumps the SQL state codes in case of an SQLException occurrence. Additionally in case the SQLStateExceptionHandling feature is turned on, the handling via "alreadyExistMessages" is inactive even if the properties for it are specified.


Example of the sqlState handling configuration property and also the SQLstate code properties.
[source]
----
<!--Switch to start handling of some of the sql exceptions via the SQL state error codes.-->
<icscdbtable:SQLStateExceptionHandling>false</icscdbtable:SQLStateExceptionHandling>
<!--Collection of values representing SQL state codes which can be interpreted to create an AlreadyExists exception-->
<icscdbtable:SQLStateAlreadyExists>23000</icscdbtable:SQLStateAlreadyExists>
<!--Collection of values representing SQL state codes which can be interpreted to create an ConnectionFailed exception-->
<icscdbtable:SQLStateConnectionFailed>08000</icscdbtable:SQLStateConnectionFailed>
<!--Collection of values representing SQL state codes which can be interpreted to create an InvalidAttributeValue exception-->
<icscdbtable:SQLStateInvalidAttributeValue>22000</icscdbtable:SQLStateInvalidAttributeValue>
<!--Collection of values representing SQL state codes which can be interpreted to create an Configuration exception.-->
<icscdbtable:SQLStateConfigurationException>0A000</icscdbtable:SQLStateConfigurationException

----

Example of the "Already exists messages" configuration property

[source]
----
<icscdbtable:alreadyExistMessages>Here insert the error message which is produced in case of an AlreadyExists situation (conflict)</icscdbtable:alreadyExistMessages>
----

From version 1.5.1.0 configuration property _jdbcDriver_ hasn't default value, so we have to set it. Old default value was "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver". Also default value was changed for configuration property _jdbcUrlTemplate_. Now default value of _jdbcUrlTemplate_ based on value of _jdbcDriver_. Default value can see in tabel elow. When connector does't know define default value based on _jdbcDriver_ we have to set it.
