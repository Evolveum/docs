= Legacy LDAP Connector

Connector for LDAP-based directory servers.
Also works for LDAP access to Active Directory.
Evolution of original Sun LDAP connector.
CDDL-licensed and JNDI-based.

[WARNING]
.Legacy
====
*This connector is a development dead-end.*
It is JNDI-based connector.
JNDI is a very bad API for LDAP and it has severe limitations.
This connector is *not maintained* any more.
It is not supported.
It is no longer actively developed.
Use the new xref:/connectors/connectors/com.evolveum.polygon.connector.ldap.LdapConnector/[LDAP Connector] instead whenever possible.
====

This connector originated from Sun ICF, taken over by OpenICF and then taken over by Polygon.
We do *not* recommend use of the original or OpenICF version.
The Polygon version has significant improvements over all other versions.
However, even the Polygon version is considered to be a legacy and it is not recommended.
