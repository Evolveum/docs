== Documentation

[NOTE]
.Patterns
====
The connectors works by matching *patterns* of the input that it receives from the Telnet/SSH channel.
Therefore also some of the configuration parameters are *patterns*. Especially the expected prompt configuration parameters `rootShellPrompt` and `loginShellPrompt`. It is usual to set them to `$` especially if `sudo` is used.
However, the dollar sign is a pattern that matches the end of line.
If set like this it will match too early and offset all the other commands.
The dollar sign needs to be escaped to avoid its special meaning.
Therefore the correct setting for prompt patterns is `\$`.

== Troubleshooting


=== Enable Logging

Set appropriate logger in midPoint:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Logger class name |

| `org.identityconnectors.solaris`
| Connector functions


| `com.jcraft.jsch`
| SSH connection details (logs from the underlying JSch library)


| `expect4j`
| Sent and received data, pattern matching (logs from the underlying Expect4j library, see also a note below)

|===

The connector is using Expect4j library to do most functions.
The logging of the connector itself should be enough for normal troubleshooting (e.g. it displays every send and received command).
But for some problems a finer logging is needed.
Unfortunately the Expect4j is using obsolete java.util.logging (JUL) framework that does not work well with ICF.
Yet there is a xref:/midpoint/reference/diag/logging/[workaround for this]. Use the following line in `logging.properties` file to enable Expect4j logging:

.logging.properties
