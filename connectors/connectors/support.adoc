= MidPoint Connector Support
:page-nav-title: Support

:page-upkeep-note: This is mostly copy&paste from old connector list in wiki. Needs updates.

MidPoint can use ConnId-compatible connectors from a variety of sources.
The connectors that are often used with midPoint are developed and maintained by Evolveum teams.
However, other ConnId-compatible connectors can be used with midPoint.

== Connector Support

Support for some (bundled) connectors is included in in basic midPoint support services.
This "bundled" support is limited only to connectors that are distributed together with midPoint.
And the support is limited, e.g. eDirectory is not supported at all, only standardized LDAP operations are supported for LDAP connector, there are limitations for Active Directory operations and so on.
Please see midPoint release notes, connector documentation and your support contract for the details.

Support for other connectors can be purchased separately.
All the connectors have their peculiarities that are often determined by the system that they connect to.
Use and capabilities of the connector can also depend on the configuration of the target system.
Therefore it is almost impossible to provide a comprehensive price list and support terms that would work for all the connectors and target systems.
For that reason a pricing for many connectors is determined on case-by-case basis.
Please contact Evolveum sales representative for the details.

//Support of this connector may need additional effort or there may be limitations.
//Please consult Evolveum sales team for the details.
//
//

//Please see connector documentation, midPoint release notes and your support contract about the details and limitations of bundled support.
//
//
//| Limited
//| Connector capabilities are limited.
//Only some of the connector capabilities are supported.
//
//
//| Experimental
//| Connector development is not finished or the connector was created purely for exploration.
//Support status of this connector is not yet completely clear.
//Experimental connectors can be supported in some cases.
//Please consult Evolveum sales team for the details.
//
//
//| Deprecated
//| Connector is deprecated.
//Although the connector may work, it is not recommended to use this connector in new midPoint deployments. +
//Some support for older connector installations is possible.
//However, this connector will not be developed any more and the support of this connector will end eventually.
//Therefore using this connector in new installations is likely to result in lost investment.
//It is recommended to use alternative connectors instead.
//
//
//| Legacy
//| Legacy connector.
//Such connector is obsolete.
//No support will be provided for this connector unless a significant investment is made.
//Any investment in this connector will most likely lead to a complete rewrite of connector code.
//
//
//| Community
//| This connector was contributed by the community or it is independently developed by the community.
//Please contact original connector author for inquiries about connector support. +
//Evolveum will not provide support for this connector unless there is a substantial incentive to do so.
//
//
//| Not recommended
//| This connector may be in active development by other (non-Evolveum) teams.
//However, Evolveum provides better alternatives for this connector.
//Use of this connector is not recommended by Evolveum.
//Evolveum will not provide any support for this connector.
//
//
//| Unknown
//| Connector status is unkown.
//There is no reliable information about the quality or functionality of the connector.
//This connector is probably outdated.
//But if there is enough interest and incentive then the connector code may be analyzed and there is a chance to support this connector.
//Please consult Evolveum sales team for the details.

== Project Polygon

The code that is currently known as "ConnId" has a turbulent history.
There were strange and uncertain times.
Project Polygon was born during such times as an attempt to stabilize situation regarding connector framework and the basic connectors.
The goal of Project Polygon was to create a set of reliable ConnId-compatible connectors that came from various sources.
Now, Project Polygon is mostly just a historical name that does not have much meaning any more.
All the Evolveum changes to ConnId framework are immediately contributed to upstream ConnId project.
And support for each connector is provided separately.
