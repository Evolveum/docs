= ConnId Framework

ConnId is a framework that does most of the provisioning operations in midPoint.
It is a descendant of Sun Identity Connector Framework (Sun ICF) which was probably the only usable open-source part of Sun Identity Manager.
ConnId is now an open project with contributors from several independent companies.
Although there was a significant number of improvements over the original Sun version the basic approach and architecture remains mostly the same.
