== Introduction

The recommended method to execute provisioning scripts in Windows environment is to use wiki:SSH+Connector[SSH Connector].

Please see wiki:Windows+SSH+Server[Windows SSH Server] page for details about Windows server setup.

If SSH is not available to you, there is also an obsolete wiki:Powershell+Support+in+AD/LDAP+Connector+-+WinRM[WinRM method]. However, this method is *deprecated* and it is not recommended.
