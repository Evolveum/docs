|===


Changes in OpenDJ are detected using _External Change Log (ECL)_ mechanism, similar mechanism to the one that was known as _Retro Change Log_ in Sun Directory Servers.
The ECL is presented as an LDAP subtree with base DN of `cn=changelog`. Each change is represented as an entry in that subtree and it remains in that subtree for few days.

Modified Identity Connector Framework (ICF) LDAP connector is recommended.
The connector scans the `cn=changelog` subtree for new entries in regular intervals.

The connector is using a special user for accessing OpenDJ, e.g. `uid=idm,ou=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com`. The connector should not use the `cn=directory manager` superuser.
Firstly, this is a best practice.
Secondly, midPoint is itself making the changes to the directory tree during provisioning.
We do not want to detect these changes in LDAP (as "echoes"), as it may cause loops in the business logic.
Therefore connector is filtering out all changes made by this user.
Therefore, this user should be dedicated to midPoint.

Need to use simulated activation (enabled/disable).


== Resource Configuration

=== Installation

As OpenDJ is no longer an open source project, getting OpenDJ distribution can be a challenge.

Get the OpenDJ zip file somewhere, unzip it at any convenient location, run the "setup" utility and configure the following recommended parameters:

[%autowidth,cols="h,1"]
|===
| LDAP Listener Port | 1389

| Administration Connector Port
| 4444

| LDAP Secure Access
| disabled

| Root User DN
| cn=Directory Manager

| Password
| secret

| Topology Options
| select "This server will be part of a replication topology", but do not change other options on this form.

| Directory Base DN
| dc=example,dc=com

| Import data from LDIF file
| link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/tree/master/samples/resources/opendj/example-base-only.ldif[https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/tree/master/samples/resources/opendj/example-base-only.ldif]

|===

Leave all other options set to their default values.

Make sure that the OpenDJ instance is started.
If it is not, use the start-ds script in the OpenDJ bin directory (or start-ds.bat in bat director on Windows) to start it.

Please note that OpenDJ 2.4.x seems to not work quite correctly with Oracle JRE 7 (this link:https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENDJ-252[applies to its Control Panel] but also to several other utilities).
Also setting OPENDS\_JAVA\_HOME to a JDK directory (not a JRE directory) seems to cause installation to fail (at least in some situations).
So e.g. Oracle JRE 6 is fine with OpenDJ 2.4.x.


=== Setting Up Directory Content

The directory server needs to be populated with data (providing at least a basic tree structure), and a midPoint administrative user has to be created.
The user is assumed to be `uid=idm,ou=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com` in following examples.
For correct midPoint operation this user needs to have an ability to execute unindexed searches.
This is necessary for iterating over all the user entries during import and reconciliation.
Although midPoint uses simple paged results and VLV controls, OpenDJ server treats this as an unindexed search.
Therefore the administrative user needs the `unindexed-search` privilege, as illustrated by the following example.

.IDM Administrative User
[source,ldif]
----
dn: uid=idm,ou=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com +
objectclass: top +
objectclass: person +
objectclass: organizationalPerson +
objectclass: inetOrgPerson +
uid: idm +
cn: IDM Administrator +
sn: IDM Administrator +
description: Special LDAP acccount used by the IDM to access the LDAP data. +
ou: Administrators +
userPassword: secret +
ds-privilege-name: unindexed-search +
ds-privilege-name: password-reset
----

You can import the base LDAP structure with the user described above (with corresponding ACI) by importing any of  `example*.ldif` files from `samples/resources/opendj` directory.

=== Enabling External ChangeLog

External Changelog is enabled when a replication is enabled.

If installing stock OpenDJ, make sure to enable replication by checking the "Server part of replication topology" (as described above).
This will enable External Change Log (ECL, `cn=changelog` LDAP subtree).

If there is an existing OpenDJ instance that does not have ECL enabled several operations needs to be executed.
Please see link:http://ludopoitou.wordpress.com/2011/05/11/opendj-enabling-the-external-change-log-on-a-single-server/[Ludo's blog entry] for the details.

=== Access Control Setup

The IDM administration account needs access rights to the `cn=changelog` suffix.

For OpenDJ on non-Windows platforms, use the following.

.Allow ACI for cn=changelog suffix (non-Windows platforms only)
[source,bash]
----
dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w secret -X -n set-access-control-handler-prop --add global-aci:"(target=\"ldap:///cn=changelog\")(targetattr=\"\*||+\")(version 3.0; acl \"IDM Access to ChangeLog\"; allow (read,search,compare) userdn=\"ldap:///uid=idm,ou=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com\";)" -n
----

Add another `allow` ACI that will provide access to root DSE attributes `changeLog`, `firstChangeNumber` and `lastChangeNumber` to the IDM admin.

.Allow ACI for root DSE (non-Windows platforms only)
[source,bash]
----
dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w secret -X -n set-access-control-handler-prop --add global-aci:"(target=\"ldap:///\")(targetattr=\"changeLog || firstChangeNumber || lastChangeNumber\")(version 3.0; acl \"IDM Access to ChangeLog\"; allow (read,search,compare) userdn=\"ldap:///uid=idm,ou=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com\";)" -n
----

For OpenDJ on Windows, please follow the following steps instead:

.Allow ACI for cn=changelog suffix - ACI for root DSE for Windows command line shell
[source]
----
Enter the dsconfig (you need run the file from bat subdirectory) interactive mode by entering:

dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w secret

Choose 1) Automatically trust (How do you want to trust the server certificate?) +
Choose 1) Access Control Handler (What do you want to configure?) +
Choose 1) View and edit the Access Control Handler (What would you like to do?) +
Choose 2) global-aci. +
Choose 2) Add one or more values (Do you want to modify the "global-aci" property?)

(target="ldap:///cn=changelog")(targetattr="\*||+")(version 3.0; acl "IDM Access to ChangeLog"; allow (read,search,compare) userdn="ldap:///uid=idm,ou=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com";)

Press Enter.

(target="ldap:///")(targetattr="changeLog || firstChangeNumber || lastChangeNumber")(version 3.0; acl "IDM Access to ChangeLog"; allow (read,search,compare) userdn="ldap:///uid=idm,ou=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com";)

Finish the command by selecting 1) Use these values.
----

Alternatively, if you are brave enough (and tired of repeating the above steps on various OpenDJ installations), you can try the following:

.Allow ACIs for Windows (an alternative, automated way)
[source,bash]
----
dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w secret <aci.txt
----

.aci.txt
[source]
----

(target="ldap:///cn=changelog")(targetattr="*||+")(version 3.0; acl "IDM Access to ChangeLog"; allow (read,search,compare) userdn="ldap:///uid=idm,ou=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com";)
(target="ldap:///")(targetattr="changeLog || firstChangeNumber || lastChangeNumber")(version 3.0; acl "IDM Access to ChangeLog"; allow (read,search,compare) userdn="ldap:///uid=idm,ou=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com";)

Please note that the script is inherently fragile, as it depends on a particular menu structure of `dsconfig`. It was tested on OpenDJ 2.4.3.

Note: OpenDJ servers version 2.4.0 and older have `deny` ACI for `cn=changelog` which needs to be removed.

=== Referential Integrity Plugin

If you plan to use LDAP groups, you should also turn the Referential Integrity Plugin on, otherwise users will remain in the LDAP groups after deletion (or rename).

.Referential Integrity Plugin
[source]
----
Enter the dsconfig (you need run the file from bin/bat subdirectory) interactive mode by entering:

dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w secret

Choose 32) Plugin +
Choose 3) View and Edit an existing Plugin +
Choose 9) Referential Integrity +
Choose 3) enabled +
Choose 2) Change it to the value: true

Finish the command by selecting f) Finish
----

=== OpenDJ JVM Tuning

To set JVM options for OpenDJ, please check file `<opendj>/config/java.properties`.

Example:

* start-ds.java-args=-server -XX:+UseCompressedOops -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m

After any change, you have to:

. run `<opendj>/bin/dsjavaproperties`

. restart OpenDJ server

== Troubleshooting

=== Check External Changelog Availability

[source,bash]
----
ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D "uid=idm,ou=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com" -w secret -b "cn=changelog" "(objectclass=\*)"
----

=== Check Replication Purge Delay

[source,bash]
----
dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D "cn=directory manager" -w secret -n get-replication-server-prop --provider-name "Multimaster Synchronization" --advanced --property replication-purge-delay -X
----

=== Change Replication Purge Delay

[source,bash]
----
dsconfig -h localhost -p 4444 -D "cn=directory manager" -w secret -n set-replication-server-prop --provider-name "Multimaster Synchronization" --set replication-purge-delay:1d -X
----

=== Purging Changelog

There seems not be no better way than to manipulate the replication purge delay.
Change the delay to 1s, wait and a second and then change it back to the original value.


=== Frequent Errors


==== Password Reset Privileges

[source]
----
LDAP: error code 50 - You do not have sufficient privileges to reset user passwords
----

This indicates that the connector user does not have privilege to reset users password.
In OpenDJ this is a special privilege and the ACI setup is not enough to enable this.
Make sure that the IDM LDAP user has the `password-reset` privilege, e.g.:

[source]
----
dn: uid=idm,ou=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com
uid: idm
...
ds-privilege-name: password-reset
----
