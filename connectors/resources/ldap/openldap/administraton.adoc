== Slapdconf

Administration of OpenLDAP is not exactly easy.
Therefore we have created an `slapdconf` utility to simplify some OpenLDAP administration tasks.
We find `slapdconf` to be an essential survival tool in the OpenLDAP world.

Slapdconf can be downloaded from the source code repository: https://github.com/Evolveum/slapdconf
It is a Perl script.

The script needs some common Perl libraries: `Net::LDAP`, `Authen::SASL` and perldoc.
The libraries can usually be installed from OS packages.
For example, this how to install them on Ubuntu:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install libnet-ldap-perl libauthen-sasl-perl perl-doc
----

Slapdconf has a comprehensive help message:

[source,bash]
----
slapdconf --help
----

In Ubuntu, the default OpenLDAP package (`slapd`) is pre-configured to tread the `root` user as LDAP server administrator.
Therefore the easiest way to configure OpenLDAP is to run `slapdconf` as root:

[source,bash]
----
sudo slapdconf list-suffixes
----

This is using the default `slapdconf` setting, which is to use `ldapi:///` endpoint of OpenLDAP and EXTERNAL SASL authentication.
The `ldapi` endpoint may not be enabled by default.
In Ubuntu, it can be enabled by modifying `SLAPD_SERVICES` line in `/etc/default/slapd` file.

The rest of this guide will use `slapdconf` for configuring OpenLDAP, as doing it using the OpenLDAP way can be quite nightmarish.


== Looking Around

Get global server configuration:

[source,bash]
----
$ slapdconf get-server-prop
olcLogLevel : stats
olcTLSCACertificateFile : /etc/ldap/tls/cacert.pem
olcTLSCertificateFile : /etc/ldap/tls/triglav.nlight.eu-cert.pem
olcTLSCertificateKeyFile : /etc/ldap/tls/triglav.nlight.eu-privkey.pem
olcTLSCipherSuite : NORMAL
----

List configured suffixes:

[source,bash]
----
$ slapdconf list-suffixes
dc=example,dc=com
dc=whatever,dc=com
----

Get suffix configuration:

[source,bash]
----
$ slapdconf get-suffix-prop dc=example,dc=com
olcDatabase : {1}hdb
olcDbDirectory : /var/lib/ldap/example
olcRootDN : cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
olcRootPW : secret
olcAccess :
  {0}to attrs=userPassword,shadowLastChange by dn="uid=idm,ou=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com" write by dn.exact=gidNumber=0+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth write by anonymous auth by self write by * none
  {1}to dn.base="" by * read
  {2}to dn.subtree="ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" by dn="uid=idm,ou=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com" write
  {3}to dn.subtree="ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com" by dn="uid=idm,ou=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com" write
  {4}to * by dn.exact=gidNumber=0+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth write by dn="uid=idm,ou=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com" read by self read by * none
olcDbConfig :

  {1}set_lk_max_objects 1500
  {2}set_lk_max_locks 1500
  {3}set_lk_max_lockers 1500
olcDbIndex :
  objectClass eq
  entryUUID eq
  entryCSN eq

== Database and Suffix Management

=== Create Database and Suffix

To create new suffix:

[source,bash ]
----
$ slapdconf add-module back_mdb
$ mkdir /var/lib/ldap/example
$ chown openldap:openldap /var/lib/ldap/example
$ slapdconf create-suffix dc=example,dc=com --dbDir /var/lib/ldap/example --dbType mdb --rootPassword secret
----

This command loads the `back_mdb` module that is needed to support database of type `mdb`. Then it creates a directory for the new database and sets correct permissions.
The last line creates the database and suffix in the server.


=== Delete Database and Suffix

To delete a suffix:

[source,bash]
----
$ service slapd stop
$ slapdadm delete-suffix dc=example,dc=com
$ service slapd start
----

[NOTE]
.Deleting a suffix
====
 OpenLDAP does not have yet a support for deleting a database (and therefore also suffix) from a running server.
The server needs to be stopped, database files deleted and configuration needs to be updated manually.
The `slapdadm` has an option to do this.
====


=== Populating the Suffix

When the suffix is created it is completely empty.
Not even the base object is there.
The following command creates the basic objects of the suffix:

[source,bash]
----
ldapgenerate -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -w secret -i -s dc=example,dc=com
----

[NOTE]
====
The suffix root user must be used explicitly when creating a base object for the suffix.
The EXTERNAL SASL authentication will not work here.
====


=== Misc

Increasing Mdb maximum size:

[source,bash]
----
$ slapdconf set-suffix-prop dc=example,dc=com olcDbMaxsize:1073741824
----

(requires server restart to apply)

== Setting up VLV

[source,bash]
----
slapdconf add-module sssvlv
slapdconf add-overlay dc=example,dc=com sssvlv olcSssVlvConfig
----

== Paging and Sizelimit

Unlike other LDAP servers OpenLDAP imposes size limit also on paged searches.
The sizelimit (soft and hard) seems to limit total number of entries returned in all pages.
To change this behavior a "prtotal" size limit needs to be set:

[source]
----
olcLimits: dn.exact="cn=idm,ou=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com" size.prtotal=unlimited
----

== Logging

See current log level:

[source,bash]
----
$ slapdconf get-log-level
olcLogLevel : stats
----

Set a log level:

[source,bash]
----
$ slapdconf set-log-level stats stats2
----

The log levels are:

* trace

* packets

* args

* conns

* BER

* filter

* config

* ACL

* stats

* stats2

* shell

* parse

* sync

* none

Set maximum logging:

[source,bash]
----
$ slapdconf set-log-level 65535
----

== Miscellaneous

Some OpenLDAP installations (namely Debian/Ubuntu) are pre-configured with short idle timeout.
This may be a reasonable setting for some cases, but it completely ruins connection pooling.
As OpenLDAP will not clearly indicate a timeout situation, this leads to mysterious `PROTOCOL_ERROR: The server will disconnect! (2)` errors.
Idle timeout can be disabled by setting it to zero:

[source,bash]
----
slapdconf set-server-prop IdleTimeout:0
----

== Frequently Asked Questions


=== What are the ERR_13748_MATCHING_RULE_NO_SYNTAX errors that are flooding my log files?

You may see errors in your logfiles that look like this:

[source]
----
2019-09-26 13:23:37,271 [] [main] INFO (org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.schema.registries.Registries): ERR_13748_MATCHING_RULE_NO_SYNTAX The MatchingRule 2.5.13.21 does not have a syntax. This is invalid
----

The short story is that those may be safely ignored.

The long story is, that every LDAP servers has its "quirks".
There is practically no LDAP server that strictly and preciselly follows LDAP standards.
In addition to that, LDAP standards are still just a human-readable text and there is no reference implementation.
Therefore the people writing LDAP servers and people writing LDAP clients do not always agree what is a standard-compliant behavior.
Those are also the likely reasons behind this message.

This specific message means that the definition of matching rule 2.5.13.21 (telephoneNumberSubstringsMatch) in OpenLDAP schema refers to a syntax 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.58 which is not defined in OpenLDAP schema.

We do not want to be judges of LDAP compliance as we are not a standard body.
The fact is that the implementation of OpenLDAP and the implementation of Apache Directory API do not agree at this point.
This particular issues may get eventually fixed in either OpenLDAP or Apache Directory API.
But as both the server and the client is made by people, it is likely that there will be more such issues in the future.

This particular issue is harmless as midPoint does not rely on explicit definition of LDAP syntaxes.
Other similar issues are very likely to be harmless too.
But it is hard to be completely sure.

Currently there is no simple way how to silence those error reports except for setting the log levels.
This can be hopefully improved in future versions of Apache Directory API.
