== SCIM2 & REST Connector Design

=== Overview

* Providing out-of-the-box support for most used & well-known API
desings
* flexible enough to handle most of REST APIs & their quirks
* not strongly tied to `Groovy` with potential to replace with more
declarative approach
* strong leaning on _declarative_ approach instead of _scripting_ ##
Design

The base connector framework is based heavily on `Strategy` &
`Delegation` pattern. The framework out-of-the-box provides multiple
configurable strategy implementations to handle common scenarios such
as:

* search
** selecting correct search strategy based on filter
** searching & retrieving object list strategy
*** using REST endpoint
*** using SCIM
*** custom implementation
* retrieving additional attributes
** multivalue attributes (references) using other search strategy

==== Groovy Builder API

Most of the groovy scripts are not full-blown scripts, but
