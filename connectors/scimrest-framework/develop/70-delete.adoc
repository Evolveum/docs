= Delete Script

== Basic Delete Script Example

The simplest delete script for `User` object class with common REST pattern, where DELETE HTTP operation is used could look like this:

[source,groovy]
----
objectClass("User") {
    delete {
        endpoint(DELETE, "/users/{id}")
    }
}
----

Where:

* this simplest script heavilly relies on default behavior of connector framework.
* The `endpoint` method specifies the endpoint to be used for
   delete operation. In this case we use path parameter `{id}` which
   will be replaced with the value of the `id` attribute of the object
   being deleted.
