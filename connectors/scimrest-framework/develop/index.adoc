= Implementing Connector using Polygon SCIMREST Framework

== Initial Steps in General

== Read-Only Connector

[arabic]
. Obtain the documentation for service / application for which connector is
written.
. Determine connection & authentication parameters
. Implement test connection
. Determine an list of objects & concepts for identity & access
management
. Implement search support for User / account object class
[arabic, start=2]
.. xref:25-user-schema/[Write schema for the User object class]
.. Determine API endpoint for the object class
.. xref:40-search-users/[Implement basic search handler for the object class]
.. Implement support for getting user by `UID` (search by filter)
.. (optional) implement advanced filtering support for search
. Implement search support for other object classes (same steps as for
first class)
. Based on application and documentation determine relations
(associations) between supported object classes
. Implement schema for relations (associations)
. Implement fetching related objects (associations)

== Additional tasks / steps

* Implement configuration discovery

== Read-Write Connector

[arabic]
. Implement create operation for the object classes
. Implement update operation for the object classes
. Implement delete operation for the object classes
