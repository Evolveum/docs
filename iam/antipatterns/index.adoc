There are often practices and ideas that are very common - and very wrong.
They are used often, but they usually fail miserably.
These are the IAM _antipatterns_ and _misconceptions_.
Also, IAM can is not a simple field, with many pitfalls and dead ends.
This section of the documentation documents these - for you to avoid them.

// IDEAS:
//
//   Garbage in, garbage out:
//     Relying on a wrong input data
//     Input data are *always* wrong: typos, data not deleted, out of date
//     Making it worse by neglect, e.g. not synchronizing properly
//     Messaging-based data feed without reconciliation, relying on message broker not to loose messages
//
//   Pump&dump provisioning (pull provisioning). E.g. pulling data from HR to LDAP, from LDAP to application databases (copying data)
//     Both antipattern and common industry practice
//     Problem: low visibility Where are my data?
//              Are data deprovisioned? You can disable auth, but the data may stay (and often they do)
//              How often do the app synchronizes? Does the sync work?
//              In-app permissions, not visible to IGA
//     If you have to do it, do at least this:
//              Must use centralized auth, otherwise problem with credential sync and emergency disable
//              Double checks, triple check that you have good error handling and reporting
//              Must have system monitoring framework and centralized logging, reporting sync errors there (e.g. missed delete)
//              Must include the application in regular audits and data protection reviews, comparing data
