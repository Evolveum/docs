They are used often, but they usually fail miserably.

// IDEAS:
//   Garbage in, garbage out:
//     Relying on a wrong input data
//     Input data are *always* wrong: typos, data not deleted, out of date
//     Making it worse by neglect, e.g. not synchronizing properly
//     Messaging-based data feed without reconciliation, relying on message broker not to loose messages
//   Indirect provisioning (e.g. provisioning through other provisioning system or DB table, without feedback)
