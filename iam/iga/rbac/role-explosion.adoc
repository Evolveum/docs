xref:/iam/iga/rbac/[Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)] is an access control model used in many identity management deployments.
The problem is that traditional static RBAC model does not scale.
RBAC is fine, for few tens of roles.
As the number of connected systems grow, the number of roles grows as well.
Organization with a thousand employees can easily end up with few of thousands of roles.
The difficult problem of managing thousand employees will be transformed to even more difficult problem of managing few thousands of roles.

The reasons are quite understandable, but they are far from being obvious:

* *Cartesian product:* Let's have roles for bank teller, supervisor and branch director.
Let's operate in London, Berlin and Bratislava.
We need a role for `London teller`, `Berlin teller`, ... 9 roles total.
The number of roles grows very quickly.

* *Atomization:* Cartesian product can sometime be avoided by decomposing roles to re-usable re-combinable units.
Combine them to a "higher-order" roles using role hierarchy.
This gives us 6 roles instead of 9.
Unless the teller shares part of the access rights with janitor.
Then we need `Basic branch office access` role, `Teller's IT access` role and a `Teller` role that combines these two.
Now we have 8 roles.
The number of roles still grows quite quickly.

* *Unique access* or *policy exceptions*: Many employees have one-of-a-kind set of access rights.
Any attempt to fit them into the roles will inevitably result in a number of roles that is equal or greater than the number of such employees.
This is quite pointless.

* *Lack of policy*: RBAC may be used as an "alternative" to policy.
If we do not know what the access control policy is, we just set up some roles and we are fine.
This usually leads to high number of roles, as the roles are often created without much oversight or coordination.
Duplicates (roles with the same set of permissions) are quite common.

* *Poor role management*: Roles, as all identity management concepts, have their _lifecycle_.
Role is created, maintained, updated, and then finally it is decommissioned.
As role management is quite a demanding tasks, organizations are often cutting the corners.
Roles are created, as they are needed.
There may be few updates to roles, usually adding more permissions.
However, roles are almost never deleted, as there is very little motivation to do so.
This leads to ever-increasing number of roles.

This is known as _role explosion_.
It is a severe disease of many IDM projects.
A project that started with good intention to simplify user management will end up with a role structure that is much more difficult to maintain than it was before the project.

Static RBAC model cannot handle role explosion.
There are some solutions that can, more or less:

* *Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC):* The principle is that instead of having roles there are expressions that computes access rights.
The expressions take user attributes as parameters.
It seems to be very flexible, perhaps a bit too flexible.
It replaces formal structure of roles with logic.
That means programming, instead of configuration.
Even worse, for ABAC/PBAC to work properly the policy must be known, well-specified and formalized.
This is xref:/iam/myths/policies-are-easy/[much harder than it may seem].
It is also quite difficult to apply ABAC policies directly to provisioning, as ABAC often relies on _context_ data that are not available at the provisioning time.
ABAC/PBAC may solve the problem of role management, but does it also solve the generic problem of policy complexity and management?

* *RBAC, but forget about least privilege:* Create "bigger" roles than what would the principle of least privilege dictate.
Over-provision the users by purpose: create roles that grant much more permissions than they should grant.
This improves role re-use and keeps the number of roles manageable.
Although it results in a less secure situation it may be good approach for some environments.

* *Spice up roles with some logic:* That usually means adding _rules_ to make roles more generic.
E.g. instead of creating `London teller` create a parametric role `Teller` that takes locality from user profile as a parameter, and computes the path to the home directory.
This is somewhere between ABAC/PBAC and static RBAC.
It has good features from both approaches and seems to be the most popular choice for provisioning systems.
E.g midPoint has a very feature-rich support for xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/pdrbac/[Policy-Driven Role-Based Access Control].

* *Manage the chaos:* Let users request access rights, let others approve it.
This is the xref:/iam/iga/capabilities/access-request/[access request] process.
The obvious problem is how to revoke the unneeded rights.
There needs to be yet another process to review and revoke them, usually called xref:/iam/iga/capabilities/certification/[certification].
However, certification campaigns require huge effort.
This is a compromise between security and usability as there is always someone who have approved and/or certified what he shouldn't have.
Especially considering the fact that the approvals are often done by "I just look at it and if it seems OK I approve".
It is difficult to enforce good scrutiny during approvals especially if someone has to approve hundreds of requests each day.

Practical enterprise IDM solution will most likely need all of these mechanisms, not just one.
Dynamic roles and approvals are the two most critical features when fighting a role explosion with a provisioning system.
