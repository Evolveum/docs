There are often practices and ideas that are very common - and very wrong.
They are used often, but they usually fail miserably.
These are the IAM _myths_, misconceptions, antipatterns and pitfalls.
Identity and access management is not a simple field, that are many obstacles and complexities to handle.
Quite understandably, there are many ways to do thing incorrectly, many dead ends.
Due to the complexity, the dead ends are often not very obvious.
Implementation teams may spend years, only to find out that the huge invested effort was utterly pointless.

This section of the documentation documents _IAM myths_ - for you to be able to avoid them.
Each myth starts with an idea that may look good at first sight.
However, it ends up in tears.

// IDEAS:
//
//  Authorization is all about allow/deny decisions (search query, autz preview: e.g. enabled/disabled buttons, properties noaccess/read/write)
//
//   My data are in great shape
//     My data are completely correct. My HR database in perfect, all data are right.
//     They are not.
//     Everybody overestimates quality of their data.
//     Garbage in, garbage out.
//     Relying on a wrong input data
//     Input data are *always* wrong: typos, data not deleted, out of date.
//     Maiden names persist for years, work positions and locations not updated, wrong transliteration of foreign names, ...
//     Making it worse by neglect, e.g. not synchronizing properly
//     Data must be validated, continually compared with reality, otherwise they will decay.
//
//   IGA is process-oriented:
//     All the wise IDM advice from 2000s and 2010s said: IDM is all about processes.
//     Map your IDM processes, automate them, and you have great IDM solution.
//     This is an advice that may look reasonable, especially from process management point of view.
//     Yet it was not working well for IDM, it will certainly not work for IGA.
//     IGA is not "process-based". It might be "algorithm-oriented" at best. In fact, IGA is *policy-oriented*.
//     IGA is all about policies, not processes.
//     Processes are just a consequence of policy enforcement.
//     *Do not use process as a substitution for policy*. It will not work.
//     Policy has to be enforced consistently, in various situations, under all circumstances.
//     It is extremely difficult to set up a process that handles all the situations and circumstances well.
//     However, IGA platform is designed to do just that. Rely on the platform, not processes.
//     Note: we are not saying that processes are not interesting.
//     Current processes have policy information embedded in them, information that is not recorded anywhere else.
//     Analyze the processes, discover the policies hidden in them, then discard the processes and implement the policies correctly and consistently.
//
//   IGA must adapt to your processes:
//     You can do that.
//     However, it will be costly, slow and very difficult to maintain.
//     It may be better idea to adapt your processes to IGA,
//     as many IGA platforms come with "best practice" configuration pretty much out-of-the-box.
//     Admit it, your processes are likely to be wrong anyway.
//     You will have to change them anyway, otherwise you will have difficulty to comply with new wave of regulations and standards.
//     At least, go half the way, adapt IGA to your needs and adapt your processes to IGA.
//
//   Pump&dump provisioning (pull provisioning). E.g. pulling data from HR to LDAP, from LDAP to application databases (copying data)
//     Both antipattern and common industry practice
//     Problem: low visibility Where are my data?
//              Are data deprovisioned? You can disable auth, but the data may stay (and often they do)
//              How often do the app synchronizes? Does the sync work?
//              In-app permissions, not visible to IGA
//     If you have to do it, do at least this:
//              Must use centralized auth, otherwise problem with credential sync and emergency disable
//              Double checks, triple check that you have good error handling and reporting
//              Must have system monitoring framework and centralized logging, reporting sync errors there (e.g. missed delete)
//              Must include the application in regular audits and data protection reviews, comparing data
//
//   AI will do it for us:
//     We cannot handle all the identity mess we have.
//     We do not have the knowledge and skill to do it.
//     Let's buy some magic AI, and it will do it for us.
//     It won't.
//     AI is a great tool, but it can only us much as it was taught to do.
//     It cannot sort out your mess, because your mess is vastly different from anyone else's mess.
//     Cleaning up your identity mess requires knowledge about your users and organization.
//     Knowledge that AI could not learn from anywhere else, and you do not have enough data to train AI yourself.
//     If you try to do that, you will get artificial garbage instead of artificial intelligence.
//     The algorithms will only further embed the mess you have instead of clearing it up.
//     Having said that, there *are* tools in the AI family that can provide great value.
//     Role mining, outlier detection ... tools that detect patterns. They work.
//     AI can provide suggestions for you to review.
//     However, they still need your supervision.
//     There will be good suggestions, yet there will be garbage as well.
//     You have to tell it what is right and what is wrong.
//     AI will not magically provide the knowledge that you do not have.
//     AI can make you much more efficient, but it will not work without your knowledge.
//     It is a tool that can help you, it cannot replace you.
//
//  Other:
//   * Messaging-based data feed without reconciliation, relying on message broker not to loose messages
