== Introduction

Basic idea of role-based access control (RBAC) is very simple: instead of assigning the same privileges to users over and over again, letâ€™s group such privileges into roles.
Then assign roles to users.
This often aligns with organizational roles such as _manager_, _assistant_ or _analyst_.
Therefore, roles are quite easy to understand even on an intuitive level.
RBAC should make your life easier - at least in theory.
