== Description

Organizational unit, division, section, object gropup, team, project or any other form of organizing things and/or people.
The OrgType objects are designed to form a hierarchical organizational structure (or rather several parallel organizational structures).

Orgs are designed for grouping of objects.
Orgs usually group users, but they can group any kind of objects (roles, policies, resources, etc.)
This can be used to create a flexible delegated administration setup.

See xref:/midpoint/reference/org/organizational-structure/[Organizational Structure] page for general introduction to the concepts.

OrgType, as all the midPoint objects, is a subtype of xref:/midpoint/architecture/archive/data-model/midpoint-common-schema/objecttype/[ObjectType].
Therefore it has all the basic properties such as `name` and `description`.

OrgType has a common supertype with xref:/midpoint/architecture/archive/data-model/midpoint-common-schema/roletype/[RoleType].
Therefore Orgs can also work as roles and OrgType has almost all of the properties that xref:/midpoint/architecture/archive/data-model/midpoint-common-schema/roletype/[RoleType] has.
Although roles and orgs are very similar there is one principal difference:
Orgs are designed for grouping, roles are designed for flexible policy definition.

OrgType is also a xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/focus-and-projections/[focal type].
Therefore it can behave as a "focus" (authoritative object) in midPoint xref:/midpoint/reference/synchronization/introduction/[synchronization].
In that case the Orgs can correspond to LDAP OUs or groups or any similar resource objects.
