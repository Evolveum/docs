== Description

The provisioning interface can be used to read data from the resources and apply changes to the resources.
Implementations of this interface carry our provisioning tasks on resources: creating accounts, adding accounts to groups, managing account attributes, etc.
It can be used to manage numerous types of resource objects, e.g. groups, roles, organizational units.

For general introduction to interface concepts please see wiki:Common+Interface+Concepts[Common Interface Concepts] page.

The types of resource objects that a specific resource supports is defined by the resource schema.
Resource schema is dynamic, available only at run-time, therefore it is not part of this interface definition.
This interface only provides access to the resource schema, but does not define its content.

The specific features of this interface depend on capabilities of the resource.
E.g. some resources may be able to force password change, others may not.

This interface is an extension of generic wiki:Object+Access+Interface[Object Access Interface]. Supported object types:

* wiki:MidPoint+Common+Schema[Resource]

* wiki:MidPoint+Common+Schema[Resource Object Shadow] and sub-types

Supported extra data types:

* Resource Object (from wiki:Resource+Schema[Resource Schema])
