== Description

Identity Repository Interface provides repository for objects that are commonly found  in identity management deployments.
It stores objects that are defined by the wiki:Data+Model[Data Model]. It allows to read, create, update and delete objects (CRUD), it also provides operations for searching for the object and support references between objects.
It assumes that all objects are uniquely identified using wiki:Object+ID[Object ID].

For general introduction to interface concepts please see wiki:Common+Interface+Concepts[Common Interface Concepts] page.

Identity repository may add some kind of basic consistency logic in addition to a pure storage of data.
E.g. it may check referential consistency, validate schema, etc.
But is must not implement any business logic.

Identity Repository also provides basic functions for task coordination, but the full scope of task coordination is provided by wiki:Task+Manager+Interface[Task Manager Interface].
