In midPoint terminology, _abstract role_ is any type of object that acts as a role.
An abstract role can be used to give privileges to other objects.

The following object types are abstract roles in midPoint:

* Role (`RoleType`)
* Org (`OrgType`)
* Service (`ServiceType`)
* Archetype (`ArchetypeType`) - since midPoint 4.0

All these object types may act as roles:

* They can cause provisioning of accounts or other resource objects.
* They may contain other abstract roles.
* They can form a platform for xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/policy-rules/[Policy Rules].
* â€¦ and so on.

In simple technical terms, _abstract role_ means that the object may contain an xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/assignment/assignment-vs-inducement/[inducement].
