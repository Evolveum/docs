Main subsystem interfaces in link:https://evolveum.com/[midPoint] use a very similar philosophy and approach.
All the interfaces provide manipulation of the identity objects (objects from the xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/[data model]), therefore it is quite expected that all the interfaces will provide similar semantics.
The common functions provided by all the interfaces are:

* Create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations with objects.
These operations are in fact called `add`, `get`, `modify` and `delete` in midPoint.

* Listing and searching for objects

* Operations that implement commonly used associations between objects

Concepts described here apply to the following interfaces:

* wiki:IDM+Model+Interface[IDM Model Interface] (Model API)

* Provisioning Service Interface (Provisioning API)

* Task Manager API (partially)

* Repository API


== One Size Does Not Fit All

The interfaces are similar, not same.
Repository API is a bit different than the Model API because it does a slightly different thing.
Operation arguments and return values are usually similar, but errors (exceptions) and constraints are quite different.
As these are also part of the interface definition, we cannot say that all the interfaces are the same.

The interfaces are leaky abstractions.
E.g. Some repository implementations may be able to do atomic operations, other may not.
Some resources may be able to check schema, other may not.
Therefore the interface definition is frequently using _should_ instead of _must_. This is a hint to interface implementers to do the best possible thing, but the client will not be able to rely on this in all cases.

Although the current definition and also implementation of the interfaces are reasonably stable some changes and improvements are still expected.
Any comments and suggestions are welcome.


== CRUD operations

All the major interfaces implement basic CRUD operation set.
The operations are modeled in accord with midPoint xref:/midpoint/architecture/concepts/consistency-model/[consistency model]. That means that they work with relative changes, without transactions or any heavyweight locking.

Primary object identifier is xref:/midpoint/devel/prism/concepts/object-identifier/[OID]. This identifier is assigned to object on create (`add`) and it stays with the object to its death.
OID is returned from `add` operation and from `search`/`list` operations; all other operations require it to manipulate objects.

Many operations take class (object type) as an argument.
Even though that may seem as an overkill, it provides substantial advantage and flexibility in the implementation.
Consider a setup where users should be stored in the LDAP directory while we want to keep tasks in the relational database.
If `get` operation would not have `type` parameter, it would not be possible to determine whether the request should be routed to LDAP directory or to the database.
Similarly for `modify` and `delete`. The presence of type allows for optimizations and flexibility.
It also provides some additional type safety by using Java generics.

All the operations may fail if the object being created, modified or even read does not conform to the schema.
Implementation may or may not be able to do this check, but client should be prepared to get schema violation errors.
Implementations should do the schema check if they can do it efficiently.


=== add

The `add` operation creates a new object.
The object is identified by OID, which may or may not be provided by the client.
If OID is not provided, it will be generated (and returned).
It is generally recommended *not* to provide OID and let the system generate it.
The specific value of OID should not matter anyway.

The operation should fail if object with such OID already exists.
It may also fail on other constraints that depend on the object type and specific subsystem.
E.g. repository implementation will fail if a <name> property of a new User object (`UserType`) belong to a user that already exists in the repository.

The operation should be atomic if possible.
It should not allow creation of two objects with the same OID (even if created in parallel).
The operation should either fail completely, so that nothing would be created; or a complete object should be created.
But, as state above, this may not be possible in all implementations.


=== get

The `get` operation returns an object identified by OID.
It fails if the object does not exist.
This operation is "safe" in a way that it must not have any side-effects and must not change the state of the objects.

The implementation may be able to _resolve_ xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/object-references/[object references]. The client may request that the resulting object should be returned as xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/object-references/[composite], instead of a plain object with references.
This approach may be more efficient for some applications.


=== modify

The `modify` operation changes an object.
It uses xref:/midpoint/architecture/concepts/consistency-model/[relative change] description to modify the object.
The intent is to be able to _merge_ most of the operations on the same object without locking or transactions.
The locking and transactions are impractical in the identity management, as individual operations on objects may take hours, days or even weeks (e.g. approvals, asynchronous provisioning, manual tasks, etc).


=== delete

The `delete` operation irreversibly removes the object.


== List and Search

The `list` and `search` operations look for objects.
They return all objects of selected type (`list`) or objects of selected type that match a specified xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/query/xml-query-language/[filter].

Search operations may use _paging_, which is a support to return specific subset of the results.
This feature is intended for efficient paged display of the results and also for efficient iterative processing of the results (including remote processing).
Local interfaces may also use `iterativeSearch` where the results are processed by a call-back handler.


== Conventions

Interface operations should be named as _<operation><objectType>_ e.g. `searchObjects, testResource`. The operations that returns single object instance or works on single object should be named in singular (e.g. `addObject`). The operation that return multiple instances should be named in plural (e.g. `listObjects`). Operations names should be unified as well:

* add, modify, delete - write single object (identified by OID)

* get - retrieve single object by OID

* list - returning all objects, none or fixed search criteria

* search - returning subset of objects with flexible search criteria (xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/query/xml-query-language/[filter])

The operations named `get` should be efficient.
The overhead to execute them should be low, e.g. direct fetch of a single object using an indexed path (`getObject`). The operations named `list` or `search` may have higher overhead.
E.g. they may use less efficient indexes or even unindexed paths.


== Operation Status, Context and Error Handling

The wiki:Task[Task] structure provides a context to most midPoint operations.
It contains contextual information such as identity of the user that invoked the operation, it contains security context, it may be bound to scheduling data and so on.
It also holds the wiki:OperationResult[operation result] data structure (see below).
See wiki:Task[Task] page for a detailed description.

Error reporting and handling is one of the most important concepts in the interfaces.
The interfaces provide two mechanisms to describe errors and error conditions:

* Java Exceptions (or SOAP faults, HTTP error responses and similar mechanisms) indicate severe errors that cause whole operation to fail.
The capabilities of these mechanisms are very limited.
E.g. they cannot provide track of the complete operation or cannot indicate partial success.
But such mechanisms are widely supported and acceptably well understood.
They also provide propagation of critical and unexpected errors (e.g. "runtime" exceptions).

* wiki:OperationResult[Operation Result] is used as a rich data structure that describe useful information about the whole operation and its suboperations.
It describes what parts of the operation failed and provides a rich diagnostics information to display to user.

The exceptions are "standardized" through the system.
A common set of exceptions is defined in the infrastructure subsystem and these exceptions are reused by the interfaces.
Most of the exceptions are checked exceptions that define a specific circumstances (semantics) of the error.
Therefore it is usually sufficient to react to (catch) a specific exception to handle the error.
More sophisticated error handling is possible by inspecting the wiki:OperationResult[Operation Result].
