= Assignment × inducement × entitlement
:page-toc: top

In midPoint, inducement, entitlement, and assignment are distinct but interconnected concepts within its Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) framework.
This is a quick primer for you to help you understand the differences between these concepts that may be confusing for newcomers.

== Assignment

* Definition: A direct association between a user (or other focal object) and a resource object (e.g., an account, role, organizational unit). Assignments define the desired state of the system.
* Purpose: Grants access rights or provisions resources directly to a user. For example, assigning a role to a user grants them the rights defined by that role.
* Mechanism:
    ** Direct Assignment: A user is explicitly assigned a role, account, or organizational unit.
    ** Construction Assignments: Define how a resource object (e.g., an LDAP account) should be created for the user.

.Example definition assigning a role to a user, triggering possible inducements in the role
[source,xml]
----
<assignment>
  <targetRef oid="role-oid" type="RoleType"/>
</assignment>
----

== Inducement

* Definition: A role-based mechanism that applies to users who are assigned the role. Inducements are indirect assignments embedded within roles.
* Purpose: Enables roles to define access policies that propagate to users. For example, a role might include inducements to create accounts or assign entitlements to users.
* Mechanism:
    ** Role Hierarchy: Inducements in a role apply to users who inherit the role (directly or via hierarchy).
    ** Indirect Application: Inducements are not applied directly to the user but to the role, which then affects the user.

Example:

.Example inducement in a role. Anyone who is assigned the role receives an LDAP account via the inducement in the role.
[source,xml]
----
<role oid="role-oid">
  <inducement>
    <construction>
      <resourceRef oid="ldap-resource-oid"/>
      <kind>account</kind>
    </construction>
  </inducement>
</role>
----

== Entitlement

* Definition: A resource-specific access right (e.g., group membership, privilege, or application role) provisioned on a target system (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory).
* Purpose: Represents the actual access granted to a user on a resource. Entitlements are often managed via assignments or inducements.
* Mechanism:
    ** Entitlement Associations: Roles or assignments can define entitlements (e.g., group memberships) that are synchronized to the resource.
    ** Schema Handling: Entitlements are defined in the resource's schema (e.g., LDAP group schema) and are provisioned based on midPoint's synchronization logic.

.Example inducement containing an entitlement on the LDAP resource to create a group to which are users with the role assigned
[source,xml]
----
<inducement>
  <construction>
    <resourceRef oid="ldap-resource-oid"/>
    <kind>entitlement</kind>
    <intent>group</intent>
  </construction>
</inducement>

| Example       | Assigning a role to a user          | Role creates an LDAP account for users   | LDAP group membership for a user
| Configuration | Defined in user objects             | Defined in role objects                  | Defined in resource schema

== How they interact

. Assignments directly link a user to a role or resource object.
. Inducements in the role define what happens when the role is assigned (e.g., create an account or entitlement).
. Entitlements are the result of inducements or assignments, representing actual access on the resource.

== Example workflow

. A user is assigned the "Customer Admin Role" (assignment).
. The role contains an inducement to create an LDAP account and assign group membership.
. midPoint provisions the entitlement (LDAP group membership) on the resource.

== Use cases

* Assignment: Directly assign a role to a user for immediate access.
* Inducement: Define reusable access policies in roles (e.g., "All sales managers get CRM access").
* Entitlement: Ensure users have specific group memberships or privileges on external systems.

This structure allows midPoint to manage complex access policies efficiently, leveraging RBAC principles while maintaining flexibility through dynamic mappings and synchronization.
