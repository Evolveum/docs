Accessibility is an important part of our ongoing product improvement efforts.
We are in the process of enhancing midPoint to better support users with diverse abilities and to improve the overall usability of the product.

We are currently focused on identifying and addressing accessibility issues that may impact key end-user journeys within the product. Following this phase, we aim to achieve conformance with WCAG 2.2 Level AA for the defined scope of the end-user interface.
This work is closely aligned with our broader goal of delivering intuitive and usable experiences for all users, including people with disabilities.

In parallel with product improvements, we are strengthening our internal practices so that accessibility is considered as a natural part of design, development, and testing activities across teams.

To support transparency, we publish our current accessibility conformance information in a xref:wcag-vpat.adoc[WCAG Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR)] provided in the form of a VPAT.
