WARNING: This is draft specification, only a part of described functionality is available.
This is all *experimental*.
The language design and concepts are still subject to change.

Axiom is data modeling language used to model data (and metadata) in an abstract, representation-independent way.

This document describes the syntax and semantics of version {version} of Axiom language.
This document will also describe how a data model defined in Axiom model is
encoded in XML, JSON, YAML and Axiom language.

== Introduction

Axiom is representation-independent data modeling language.
Axiom can be used to model data in their abstract form.
Unlike other modeling languages, Axiom is not bound to specific data representation from such as JSON or XML.
Data modeled in Axiom can be represented (serialized and parsed) in many representation formats.
Simply speaking, the same data can be expressed in XML, JSON, YAML and possibly also in other formats, including Axiom itself.
