*Primary source:*wiki:Test+Scenarios[ Test Scenarios]. As a minimum, we should cover all tests described there, before releasing midPoint 3.2. Please note the result of testing each of test group into the table below.

*Alternative sources:*

* Gusto has tested things from wiki:Live+Demo[Live Demo] (from "Have a look around" to "Organizational Structure", inclusive).

* Kate is creating automated Selenium-based tests: wiki:GUI+Testing[GUI Testing]

So, tests (from Test Scenarios) that have been covered by some of these alternative sources, *do not have* to be tested manually.
But please indicate this fact in the table below.
