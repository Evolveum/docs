= Security and Authorization Roles in midPoint
:page-nav-title: Security and Authorization Roles
:page-toc: top


This document contains working documentation to preparation of security roles for midPoint.

== Structure of security roles

There will be top level business role "Security officer" - this role will not probably be initial role in midPoint as its content is organization specific.
We will define *application roles* for definition of access level to midPoint and *authorization roles* defining actual authorization blocks for operations.

=== High level structure

| Business Role | Application Role  | Note
| Security Officer | | Security officer within an organization - privileged access to multiple systems, not only midPoint.
| | midPoint:Security Officer | Security officer within midPoint
| | ... | Other roles providing access to other applications...
| Internal Auditor | | Internal auditor within an organization - read-only auditor access to multiple systems, not only midPoint.
| | midPoint:Auditor | Auditor role within midPoint
| | ... | Other roles providing access to other applications
|===

Each application role will consist of a list of authorization roles as defined below:

== MidPoint initial objects

We should define 2 application roles + list of authorization roles:

Application roles:

* midPoint:Security Officer
* midPoint:Auditor

These roles should provide access to midPoint for defines security functions. They are not customized to specific archetypes/situations. If necessary, they, or the copies must be tuned by engineers in specific projects.

== Authorization roles

| 3 | midPoint:report reader | Read created reports. | Can't run reports.
| 4 | midPoint:audit reader | Read audit events - and objects history | We can't limit user's access to audit objects. So full access or no access to audit. Of course - read only.

== Open questions

* REST access - allow to whom ?

* What object types we will consider as "data" and which are "configuration"
    data::
        UserType, RoleType, ServiceType, OrgType, PolicyType
    configuration::
        ObjectmarkType,
    ?::
        ArchetypeType,

* Shouldn't we add some attribute to all objects specifying if the object is data or configuration ?

    ** Example: Authorization roles mentioned in this document are definitelly configuration ano not data. +
Users who does not have authorization to "modify configuration" should not have access to modify these roles.

    ** In the RoleType, we can specify what is configuration and what is data, excluding "Authorization role" archetype and "system roles" archetype (for sure?), just this:

    *** is not consistent across all object types - other object types (e.g. Orgs) may have different definition of data and configuration
    *** is harder to read for engineers - and not clear everywhere. isConfiguration (True/False) is much cleaner.
    *** is even "system roles" only configuration ? Can't it be data as well ? Can we use other system roles for this ?
    *** in each project it would be easier to define what is configuration and what is data if engineer can define just objects in the project.
    *** is slower for processing - getting and comparing single attribute value is the fastest operation. And this can be compared very often.

* Should we use archetype "System role" ? Existing midpoint roles are using it, but we need 2 levels - system roles and authorization roles.

    ** Can't engineer define other "system roles" for other systems ? Shouldn't we have "application roles already" ?
    *** If we create midpoint:Security officer as "application role", then  - how we define what application roles are data and what is configuration ?
