| Description
| This is about approving an elementary change (that is to be executed), e.g. assignment of a role.
| This is about approving a single fact (that was found), e.g. existence of an assignment of a role.
| This is about sorting out a single issue, e.g. non-existence of an org manager, or a need to manually create an account somewhere.

| Description
| It could contain any number of elementary changes requiring approval (along with other changes that could be directly executed).
| Campaign is a set of cases being processed at once.
A campaign can be a standard or ad-hoc one.
