====

MidPoint currently uses link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)[DOT graph description language] to visualize configurations of resources.
It generates DOT files and sends them to external _DOT renderer_ to convert them to SVG format.
Such renderers are usually part of the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz[Graphviz] package.

So, in order to make the visualization work in your case, please install Graphviz on your midPoint server and check that you can execute the following command:

[source]
----
$ dot
----

This command (with the argument of `-Tsvg` to provide SVG output) is used by midPoint to render DOT files as SVG pictures.


== Configuration

You can configure the DOT renderer by specifying the respective command in `config.xml` file under `configuration/midpoint/dot/renderer`  key, like this:

[source]
----
<configuration>
   <midpoint>
      <dot>
	     <renderer>/path/to/dot/executable</renderer>
      </dot>
      ...
   </midpoint>
</configuration>
----

The default value is `dot` that works well with the default installation of Graphviz.

Note that `-Tsvg`  parameter is always appended to the command specified.
The input DOT file is then sent as a standard input to the process, expecting SVG on standard output.


== Versions

DOT rendering of resource configurations should work with any reasonably recent Graphviz version.
It was tested with 2.38.0.
