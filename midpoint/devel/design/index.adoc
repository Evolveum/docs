= MidPoint Design Notes
:page-wiki-name: Design Notes
:page-liquid:

This section contains an unstructured selection of random design notes on various topics.

This is a place to record and explain architectural and design decisions, motivations and general thoughts.
This keeps a non-formal list of things that should not be forgotten.
Once formalized, important parts of those notes should be rewritten to feature and configuration pages.

Some of the pages may be quite outdated, others may be very unstructures (read: chaotic).
Some of the pages may describe things that are planned, or were planned and never implemented.

Use with care.
