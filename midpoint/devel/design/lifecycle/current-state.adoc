= Lifecycle: current state

This page describes the effects of object and assignments activation and lifecycle state on the behavior of various components.

It captures the current state as well as open questions and suggested changes (shown by highlighting).

== Object-level Effects

The object-level effects of object activation and lifecycle state are shown in the following table.

Notes:

. "Assignments active" refers to the effects at the level of assignments, see the next section.
. The "Ref" column refers to `TestLifecycleBasic` methods.

== Assignment-level Effects

Here we show how active and inactive assignments (driven by object lifecycle state) behave - or should behave.

#Yellow-highlighted# entries are to be clarified and/or fixed.

[.lime-background]#Green-highlighted# entries were fixed recently - see commit https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/commit/a97e0802ba0023e0289207e8dd56f87055d450ae[a97e08].

=== Inactive Assignments

NOTE: "Inactive assignments" here mean assignments of focus that is in such a state that its assignments should not be active
(e.g., draft, archived, and so on).
