= MidPoint 5 Vision

MidPoint 5.0 is going to be a major release of midPoint.
It is expected that it will bring important changes, especially in the foundations of midPoint platform, removing old technological debt.

.Work in progress
WARNING: This is still a rough plan.
It can change on any moment.

== Schedule

The schedule is not certain yet.
We plan to have midPoint 4.4 as the LTS release in autumn 2021.
MidPoint 5.0 may be the next LTS release, which might be released in autumn 2023.
However, this plan may change any time.

== Strategic Goals

* Remove technological debt, give us more options, increase development velocity
** Reduce dependencies on old Sun XML libraries.
*** This may mean moving away from JAXB completely, including the code-generation plugins
*** Moving away form XSD completely to Axiom
* Stabilization for longevity and maintainability
** Review/improve/stabilize Prism API
** GUI API for GUI customization

== Design and Plans

=== Major Achievements

* link:/midpoint/axiom/[Axiom]
* "Jasperless" reporting
* link:/midpoint/studio/[MidPoint Studio]

=== Prism and Schema Improvements

* Move to link:/midpoint/axiom/[Axiom]
* Remove `<extension>` where it is not necessary
* Primitive type for definition/schema
** Use in: resource schema, role schema, archetype schema
* Get rid of the JAXB-induced dichotomies
** PolyString vs PolyStringType
* Dynamic schema, e.g. archetype schema
* Support for "heterolists"
* Support for native "map" type, e.g. {en => foo, sk => fÃº, ... }
* Support for "list" or ordered values.
* 100% namespace-free operation
* QName and URI are the same thing.
* Move to explicit versioning (no version numbers in namespaces)
* Problem: complex properties, e.g. do we want PolyString as container? Every structured data as container?
* New code generator
* Schema cleanup
** `resource/synchronization` -> `resource/schemaHandling/objectType`


== Decisions Made

* Axiom as primary data modeling
* Move to custom reporting (removing Jasper)
* Move to IntelliJ-based MidPoint Studio
* Special repository for PostgreSQL
* ConnId2
* Performance improvements: midScale
* Data protection: midPrivacy

== Open Questions

* Complex properties, e.g. do we want PolyString as container? Every structured data as container?
* Matching rules: are we using them correctly? E.g. matching rules for polystring. Maybe they should be _string_ matching rules.

* Audit: how to store/process the data? MidPoint repo? Elastic?

* What to do with resource wizard? Keep in GUI? Rework? Move to IDE?
* Visualization? What to visualize? Where? GUI? Studio?

* What to do with Hibernate repository? Decommission? Keep?

* Improvement to:
** Diagnostics, troubleshooting, visibility
** https://wiki.evolveum.com/display/midPoint/Efficient+Deployment+Ideas[Ease of deployment]

* UX?

* External end-user GUI?

== Until We Get To 5.0

* We have to live with both XSD and Axiom


== Maintaining 5.0

* We still need to support schema extensions in XSD.
Capabilities of XSD extensions may be frozen at midPoint 4 functionality.
All the built-in schemas will be Axiom.
