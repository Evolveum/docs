== PolyString Localization vs Search/Sorting

How do we search/sort polystring which have localized content (lang or translation keys)?

Obviously, we need to pre-process the objects and store localized versions of those polystrings in some kind of "application index".
E.g. a table which will combine OID, propertyName, lang and string value.

However, this may be a hit for the database performance.
Therefore it needs to be configurable.

Maybe we could use some db-specific optimizations? E.g. can postgres do something smarter here? Will postgres-specific implementation help?
