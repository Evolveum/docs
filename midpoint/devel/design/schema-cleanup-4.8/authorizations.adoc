= Deprecated and Removed Authorizations
:page-since: 4.8
:page-toc: top

The following table describes authorizations (in particular, action URLs) that are deprecated and/or removed in 4.8.

The difference to the removal of prism items in the static schema is that unknown authorizations are silently ignored.
(Which may or may not be good; but nevertheless it is done this way.)

So, by the _removal_ we mean that they disappear from the list of known actions maintained in `ModelAuthorizationAction` enumeration.
Thus, they are no longer recognized by the midPoint logic.

By the _deprecation_ we mean that they still could be (depending on particular case) taken into account.
However, the migration tool should issue a warning about them, so that the user knows they should replace them by their up-to-date variants.

See the notes in the following table.
