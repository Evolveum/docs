| Removed.

Deprecated in 4.0 by https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/commit/fab755d8[fab755d8].
Removed in 4.8 by https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/commit/8038b70f[8038b70f].

The element was replaced by `addRemoveAttributeValues` property of `update` capability.

|
For configured capabilities, the `update` capability has to be modified according to the `addRemoveAttributeValues` content.

For native capabilities, the situation is most probably OK (as the old-style capability stopped to be produced in 4.0), but for sure, one should refresh the capabilities.
Or, the migration tool can do the same operation as for configured capabilities.

| Removed (not used anymore).

This item was used to bind approval cases and their execution tasks.
It was maintained by midPoint only, never set manually.
It is no longer used.
So, it was now simply dropped from the schema, without any replacement.

Introduced in 4.0.
Marked as deprecated in 4.0.3/4.1.
See https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/commit/e1b6fb81c18dec045605cc2a511c6d8e47f9cb33[e1b6fb81].
Removed in 4.8 by https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/commit/861b6d9a[861b6d9a].

| OtherPrivilegesLimitationType
| approvalWorkItems
| c:WorkItemSelectorType
|
|
| Used to limit delegated privileges related to approval work items.
In both 4.4 and 4.7, it is incorrectly used in the code:
Although only `caseManagementWorkItems` should be used, both `caseManagementWorkItems` and `approvalWorkItems` are used by mistake.
(At different places, with `caseManagementWorkItems` mostly ignored.)

Introduced in 3.6.
Marked as deprecated in 4.0 by https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/commit/6326a7cbb6014835680e6c01c599c28810cb0c88[6326a7cb].

The new style is consistently used only after https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/commit/c9f3fec9[c9f3fec9] (4.8).
So, I think that we cannot remove the old style, because if the user switched to the new style in 4.4 and 4.7, things would break for him.

[.green]#Processor in 4.4/4.7 does nothing, just reports a warning.#
[.green]#Processor in 4.8 does the migration.#

Removed in 4.8 by https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/commit/df9d41d4[df9d41d4].

The value of `objectResults` served as a default for both `simpleOperationExecutions` and `complexOperationExecutions`.

| oidBound
| xsd:boolean
|
|
| This property was introduced in 2014 by https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/commit/2d71af12[2d71af12].
It was marked as deprecated in that very commit.
The discussion with Radovan revealed that this is just a workaround for not knowing focus OID when mappings are evaluated.
(For new objects, i.e. `ADD` operations.)
The serious solution would be to generate OID before the operation, so that it could be used in the mappings.

See bug:MID-8867[].

Later we should do something with this, probably in similar to how tasks were migrated to activities.
| In 4.6, we improved the style of configuration of the resource objects synchronization.
It was moved into `schemaHandling/objectType` definitions and modernized.
The legacy style (`synchronization/objectSynchronization`) was marked as deprecated in the same midPoint version by https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/commit/0a58e992[0a58e992].

To migrate, use the new format.

| ActivityStateType

| 1
| This is the work state created by custom composite activities.
It is not a configuration, but a state maintained by the activity itself.

Most of the time, it is empty, like `<workState xsi:type="c:CustomCompositeWorkStateType"/>`.

In 4.4, the type was called `PureCompositeWorkStateType`, but since 4.4.4 and 4.7, it is deprecated and replaced by `CustomCompositeWorkStateType` (see https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/commit/bd840722[bd840722] and https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/commit/6a611801[6a611801]).

If we removed the type definition, the task objects of this type will be no longer readable.
(AFAIK there is no schema migration mechanism for types.)

We could write a migration code that would swap the types, but is it worth the effort?

Note that these activities are marked experimental in the schema in `ActivityCompositionType` (but not in the docs).
Moreover, there is no code bound to this type except for its definition.
So, maybe the most reasonable is to postpone removal of this type to (e.g.) 5.0.

It had problems with unordered nature of prism items, so it was replaced by sound `boundary` item and deprecated in 4.3 by https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/commit/0d0a9dff[0d0a9dff].

The migration consists of converting each `boundaryCharacters` value to `boundary` item with:

- the `position` property, starting at 1 and increasing,
- the `characters` property, containing original `boundaryCharacters` value.

For example, from

[source,xml]
----
<boundaryCharacters>a</boundaryCharacters>
<boundaryCharacters>\0-\1\a-\c</boundaryCharacters>
<boundaryCharacters>01abc</boundaryCharacters>
----

to

[source,xml]

<boundary>
    <position>1</position>
    <characters>a</characters>
</boundary>
<boundary>
    <position>2</position>
    <characters>\0-\1\a-\c</characters>

However:

1. this functionality was undocumented and experimental;
2. since approx. 4.4 it didn't work at all, due to an unrelated bug.
