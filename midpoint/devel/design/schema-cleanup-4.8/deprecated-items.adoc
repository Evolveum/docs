| Use identifier instead.

The element of the AbstractAuthenticationModuleType.
The code was reviewed, all usages of this element were removed.

4.4 -> 4.8 : AbstractAuthenticationModuleType.identifier element should be added. The value of the name attribute is to be copied to the identifier. Then name can be removed.

4.7 -> 4.8 : In case name value exists but identifier doesn't, the same steps as for 4.4. If both values exist, just remove name value (starting from 4.7 identifier appeared and was used with a higher priority than name).
If no of these 2 elements values present, it's considered to be a wrong configuration. Identifier element is set to be mandatory.
