= Security Improvements in 4.8
:page-since: 4.8
:page-toc: top

== Authorization Configuration

Before 4.8, we could specify the authorization only at the level of an object.
For example, the logged-in principal could see particular items of a given object, depending on its relation to it.
Or, it could execute some operations on that object.

In 4.8, we need more.
First of all, we need to be able to authorize operations on the level of individual items.

. A user can see or complete case work items assigned to him.
. A user can see or complete case work items assigned to people in organizations managed by him.
. A user can see only closed (or not closed) case work items.
. A user can only see other users' assignments to the roles he is an owner or approver of.
. A user can only see other users' `roleMembershipRef` values related to the roles he is an owner of approver of.

Regarding certifications, things get even more complex:

. A user can see certification cases related to people in organizations managed by him.
. A user can see certification cases related to roles he is an owner or approver of.
. A user can see or complete certification case work items assigned to him.
. A user can see or complete certification case work items assigned to people in organizations managed by him.
. A user can see only closed (or not closed) certification case work items.

NOTE: We cannot guarantee all of the above scenarios to be implemented.
We will provide more detailed analysis here later.

== Changes

- The `assignee` clause now covers all assignees, not only assignees of open work items (commit https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/commit/c97e31dc[c97e31dc]).

== Migration of the Authorizations

Please see xref:/midpoint/devel/design/schema-cleanup-4.8/authorizations.adoc[] more details.

== Open Questions

=== Value-Level Action Authorizations

Currently, only the following authorizations are evaluated at sub-object level:

. `#read` (i.e., `#search` and `#get`)
. `#completeWorkItem`
. `#delegateWorkItem`

In particular, `#add`, `#modify` nor `#delete` ones are ignored at this level.
Is it OK?
Or, should we implement that?
What will need to be resolved in that case, are relations to `#assign` and `#unassign` authorizations that would get an alternative representation of `#add` and `#delete` of `AssignmentType` value in `assignment` item.

The question is also whether we should apply sub-object authorizations when  `getEditObjectDefinition` is called.

==== Answer (28th June 2023)
We may look at this, but with a lower priority.

=== Embedding of Value-Level Authorization Selectors

Currently, the following inner value types are automatically attached to their parents:

- `AssignmentType` -> `AssignmentHolderType`:`assignment`
- `CaseWorkItemType` -> `CaseType`:`workItem`
- `AccessCertificationCaseType` -> `AccessCertificationCampaignType`:`case`
- `AccessCertificationWorkItemType` -> `AccessCertificationCaseType`:`workItem` -> `AccessCertificationCampaignType`:`case/workItem`

I.e. if there is an authorization with a selector with `type` = `AccessCertificationCaseType`, it is automatically interpreted as if it had `parent` selector of `type` = `AccessCertificationCampaignType` and `path` = `case`.

(See https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/blob/db9da87e8ee4401d803493b4307b3c0233ee4620/repo/security-enforcer-impl/src/main/java/com/evolveum/midpoint/security/enforcer/impl/Specification.java#L142-L159[`Specification#getCandidateAdjustments`] and https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/blob/db9da87e8ee4401d803493b4307b3c0233ee4620/repo/security-enforcer-impl/src/main/java/com/evolveum/midpoint/security/enforcer/impl/Specification.java#L236-L259[`Specification.Adjustment`] or their updates in https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/blob/master/repo/security-enforcer-impl/src/main/java/com/evolveum/midpoint/security/enforcer/impl/Specification.java[current source code].)

Should we add another such auto-embedded cases?
Is the treatment of `AssignmentType` ok?
(Or, should we add `inducement` embedding for it?)
Should we analyze the original container query and derive the attachments from there?

==== Answer (28th June 2023)
We will *not* support such an automatic embedding.
Each sub-object selector must be rooted in a prism object.
(#TODO implement this#)

=== Level of Support for `searchContainers` and `searchReferences` Methods

The `searchContainers` and `countContainers` currently support the following types regarding security:

- `AccessCertificationCaseType`
- `AccessCertificationWorkItemType`
- `CaseWorkItemType`
- `OperationExecutionType`
- `AssignmentType`
- `SimulationResultProcessedObjectType`

Among them, `AssignmentType` and `SimulationResultProcessedObjectType` are excluded from post-processing (i.e. application of `#get` authorizations on values returned by the search) because the repository does not return their parent objects.

Is that OK?
E.g., should we add support for `AssignmentType` filtering?
What about `searchReferences`?
In particular, do we plan to filter the metadata (accesses) content according to authorizations in 4.8?
If so, how?

==== Answer (28th June 2023)
We will have a look at both `AssignmentType` post-processing (i.e. returning the parent from the repository) and the implementation for `searchReference` - if the time permits.

=== Diagnostics Improvements

Are we going to somehow improve authorization diagnostics?
The improvements in 4.8 tried to separate authorization and value selector evaluation logic from the diagnostic logging,
in order to provide more flexibility in this area.

Should we provide alternative troubleshooting means in addition to existing one (i.e. by logging) ?
For example, dumping the structured output into CSV?
Or, integrating with the tracing?

==== Answer (27th June 2023)
The Authorization Playground page was created.
It will be improved as the time permits.

=== Support for Specific Authorization Situations

The current authorization framework is quite general and flexible, but with many limitations restricting its practical use.
What specific authorization scenarios should we support?

==== Answer (27th June 2023)
Engineers should create improvement JIRA issues what scenarios they need to handle.

=== Expression Profiles

The goal is to allow creating/editing of configuration objects (reports, roles, resource definitions, ...) by non-root users: trusted to some extent, but not as much as to be able to create arbitrary executable code.

The solution:

. There will be a limitation for the expression profile to be applied for objects with given archetype.
. User will have the ability to edit objects with given archetype (and probably only parts of them).

Partial questions:

. Will it be sufficient to have only a single expression profile for the whole object?
. What about unusual places where expressions can be found? E.g.
.. expressions in explicit filters
.. expressions in (implicit) reference filters (static / dynamic)
.. expressions in prism values e.g. configuration properties
.. any other places?

=== "Run privileged" flag

=== Auditing of "run as" / "run privileged"

. Do we want to store both original user identity and the switched one?
. Do we want to store the information "running in privileged mode"?

=== How to Authorize Management of Template-Based Objects

There are objects that could be derived from templates (or super-objects): resources, archetypes, later maybe others.
Do we need to specify authorization statements like:

. You can create/modify _only_ resources derived from given template?
. You can/cannot create/modify resources derived from given template?

=== Task Templates

Task templates are used e.g. for https://docs.evolveum.com/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/admin-gui-config/#custom-actions-for-object-lists[custom actions for object lists] in GUI.
They may need to be executed with the rights of the defining user, not the currently logged in one.

See bug:MID-6913[] and bug:MID-7831[].

How to ensure this?

=== GUI Tasks Authorization Requirements

Should we require any authorizations in order to invoke tasks from GUI?
(Like for assignment/unassignment of role members?)
