= Shadow Caching: Design

== Configuration

Levels:

- resource
- object class
- object type
- attribute/association

Predefined options (scopes) for attributes and associations:

- none
- all
- mapped

Other options:

- time to live

== Algorithms

=== Inbound Mappings

When cached data not present (or outdated), there are the following options:

- fetch the data,
- skip the mapping,
- signal an error.

=== Outbound Mappings

Sometimes, we need to fetch the data even when doing outbounds: strong and weak mappings, mapping ranges.
What will we do if the data is not there?

- fetch the data,
- signal an error.

=== Fetching the Shadow Internally by Provisioning Module

- read+replace mode,
- avoiding duplicate values?

== Other / Questions

- what about the cache after a shadow is updated?
- potential for relative changes?
- safeguards, like only one task allowed to read from the resource?
