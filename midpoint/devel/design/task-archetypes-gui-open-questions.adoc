. How to hide extension items that are not needed for the particular archetype? E.g. resource object specification for recomputation tasks.

. How to show live sync token? It is currently not defined in any XSD.

. executeOptions vs.
modelExecuteOptions

. Icons for all those archetypes.

. There is really a lot of archetypes: almost each task handler should have its own archetype because it has specific extension items to display.

.. e.g. DeleteTask - should be archetyped as Utility even if it has objectQuery+objectType to be configured?

.. also Jdbc Ping Task - uses quite a lot of task extension properties (but it's rarely, if even, used)

.. HTML reports have the same archetype as Jasper reports, resulting in irrelevant extension items displayed

.. Also single/interactive bulk action tasks (currently use two separate archetypes)


. Some properties should be converted to containers: ModelExecuteOptionsType, ExecuteScriptType (might be complicated), ...

== Util or System task category

These tasks share the generic archetype (Utility or System).
So the respective GUI will be probably a little bit messy - see extension and other items that are relevant for these tasks.
