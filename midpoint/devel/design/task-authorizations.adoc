== What we want to achieve

We want to specify access to tasks based on a relation of a user to a particular task.
The basic relations are:

* requester,

* assignee,

* object (i.e. the subject of approval - e.g. the user whose change is being approved),

* target (

See MID-3311, MID-3120, MID-3121.
