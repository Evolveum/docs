:page-wiki-name: Understanding ApprovalSchemaExecutionInformationType

This information can be obtained from workflowManager e.g. by calling getApprovalSchemaExecutionInformation (requires approval task OID).

It contains information about individual stages of approval:

. for the current stage and previous ones, we can provide exact information - see ApprovalStageExecutionRecordType:

.. events related to the stage (showing decisions done and automated completion events),

.. active work items (for current stage only),



. for future stages, we provide estimates - see ApprovalStageExecutionPreviewType:

.. expectedApproverRef,

.. expectedAutomatedOutcome,

.. expectedCompletionReason,

.. errorMessage (if anything went wrong during preview).
