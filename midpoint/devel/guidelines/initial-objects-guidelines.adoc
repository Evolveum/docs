= Initial object guidelines

Initial objects are set of objects that is imported to midPoint during the initial setup (installation).
They are located in `doc/config/initial-objects` directory in distribution zip file.

Authoritative source for these objects is located in `midpoint` git repository in `repo/system-init/src/main/resources/initial-objects`.
This folder is copied before release to `config/initial-objects` folder.

List of rules for changing initial objects:

* Changes have to be done in `repo/system-init/src/main/resources/initial-objects` folder
* Changes and their impact have to be described in release notes (`release-notes.adoc`)
* Don't change existing container IDs unless absolutely necessary (e.g. to fix a bug)
** This is to simplify updating objects in existing installations, so that computed differences between objects will not contain phantom changes.
