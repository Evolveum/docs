== Build and Deploy New Connector Version

. Connector source code is in Evolveum OpenICF git repo at github: +
link:https://github.com/Evolveum/openicf[https://github.com/Evolveum/openicf]

. Modify the connector code, build it, install to local maven repo (mvn clean install)

. Test the connector by changing the dependency in midpoint/build-system/pom.xml and running appropriate unit tests ...  or by manual jar deploy and manual test

. Commit changes (committing to `master` is OK)

. Determine connector version by using `git describe` (see below)

. Change version in connector pom.xml file.
E.g. from `1.1.1.0-SNAPSHOT` to `1.1.0.em23`. *DO NOT COMMIT* this change.

. Build the connector with the new version (mvn clean install)

. Deploy the artifacts from `target` directory to link:http://nexus.evolveum.com/[http://nexus.evolveum.com/]. Deploy to "OpenICF Releases (Evolveum)" repository.

.. User `target/reduced-pom.xml` as pom file in nexus.

.. Add the \*.jar artifact from the `target`

.. Add source artifact (if available)

.. Click "Deploy" button



. Revert the version number change in the pom.xml to avoid accidental commit (e.g. `git checkout pom.xml`)

. If the connector is a bundled midPoint connector (ldap, csvfile, dbtable, ...)  +


.. change the connector version in midpoint/build-system/pom.xml and run appropriate tests

.. change the connector version in provisioning-impl test XML files

.. update wiki:Identity+Connectors[Identity Connectors] wiki page




== Connector Versioning

Connector versions are in the form:

`a.b.c.d`

The a, b and c versions are determined by upstream development schedule (by ForgeRock OpenICF development plan).
The last number is used to Evolveum intermediary releases.
The last number is in a form `eXXX` where `XXX` is the number of commits in evolveum git repository from the last upstream release.
It can be determined by running `git describe`. E.g. the output `1.1.2.0-42-g659ec33` means that there were 42 commits from the last tag.
Therefore the connector version number will be `1.1.2.e42`.

*But ....* in the meantime while there are no tags for OpenICF releases in the evolveum repository we use `emark` tag as a reference and prepend the number with `m`. Therefore is the `git describe` displays `emark-3-g759fc53` the resulting connector version will be `1.1.0.em3`. Note the *m* letter and also note that the version is `1.1.0.emXXX` and not `1.1.1`.emXXX (the current version is `1.1.1.0-SNAPSHOT` which means that the last released version was 1.1.0.0).
