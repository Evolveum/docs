This guide explains how to configure and run MidPoint with an embedded Tomcat.
This feature is based on Spring libraries, especially the Spring Boot framework.

== Configuration

MidPoint configuration is done in the `config.xml` file located in `midpoint.home`.

An embedded Tomcat can be configured in two places:

* Default configuration file `application.yml` which is located at the following classpath: `admin-gui/src/main/resources` folder.

* Custom configuration file `application.yml` which can be placed into the `midpoint.home` folder.

The values can also be overwritten as a JVM argument (*-Dxxx* before application).
For this purpose, the JAVA_OPTS variable or *MP_SET_* variables can be used (see xref:/midpoint/install/bare-installation/midpoint-sh/[Start script]).

You can also pass the values as application arguments (*--xxx* after application).
See <<config_example_3,examples>>.

The list of available properties is based on Spring Boot configuration options and can be found in https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/3.4-SNAPSHOT/appendix/application-properties/index.html[Spring Boot documentation].

=== Custom Configuration Items

[source, yml]
----
wicket:
    request-cycle:
        timeout: 60s # specifies timeout for wicket page rendering
----

=== Configuration Example 1

This example utilizes the processing of the MP_SET_* environment variables in the xref:/midpoint/install/bare-installation/midpoint-sh/[Start script].
The result is a list of the -D parameters (as in <<config_example_2,example 2>>).
The benefit of this approach is that the options can be handled as one property per one variable.

The primary target is for the containerized environment, i.e. Docker, Kubernetes (cloud).

.start midPoint - midPoint is in the "default" location */opt/midpoint*
[source,bash]
MP_SET_server_port=8088 MP_SET_server_servlet_session_timeout=60m /opt/midpoint/bin/midpoint.sh start

It can also be used to generate a systemd service with *-Dxxx* parameters.
For details, see xref:/midpoint/install/bare-installation/midpoint-sh/[Start script].

.generate a systemd object - midPoint is in the "default" location */opt/midpoint*
[source,bash]
MP_SET_server_port=8088 MP_SET_server_servlet_session_timeout=60m /opt/midpoint/bin/midpoint.sh generate

[[config_example_2]]
=== Configuration Example 2

This is the native way to overwrite values, i.e. to set them without editing the configuration files.

.example of passing the JVM argument
[source,bash]
java -Dserver.port=8088 -Dserver.servlet.session.timeout=60m [<other parameters>] -Dmidpoint.home=/opt/midpoint-home -jar midpoint.war

.example of passing the program argument
[source,bash]
java  [<other parameters>] -Dmidpoint.home=/opt/midpoint-home -jar midpoint.war --server.port=8088 --server.servlet.session.timeout=60m

[[config_example_3]]
=== Configuration Example 3

.application.yml - JSON format
[source]
----
server.port: 8088
server.servlet.session.timeout: 60m
----

.application.yml - YAML format
[source]
----
server:
    port: 8088
    servlet:
        session:
            timeout: 60m
----

(TODO: suffix "m" does not work - should be updated!)

=== Other Configuration

* Banner (midPoint logo in logs)
    ** Using the standard Spring Boot `banner.txt` file.
* Static files moved to `src/main/resources/static` (default for Spring Boot)

== JDBC Drivers

Currently, midPoint bundles only the PostgreSQL JDBC driver.
If you want to deploy a standalone midPoint with a different database, then the JDBC driver must be copied to `midpoint.home/lib`.

== Executable Jar Start/Stop

See an example command with minimum options (memory and `midpoint.home` configuration) using `midpoint.war` from the `dist/target` folder:

.Start command example
[source,bash]
----
java -Xms768m -Xmx2048m -Dmidpoint.home=/opt/midpoint-home -Dmidpoint.nodeId=node1 -jar midpoint.war
----

Other options can be added from the list of properties (table above) using `-D` option, e.g. `-Dserver.port=12345`.
The options stated explicitly in the command will override defaults located in `midpoint.home`/application.yml.

== Using midPoint with Embedded Tomcat

Use the default URL (modify hostname and port as required): http://localhost:8080/

== Autoconfiguration

The midPoint web application is autoconfigured by using the `com.evolveum.midpoint.web.boot.MidPointSpringApplication` class as a starting point.
Spring boot will process all the annotated methods of this class using the "configuration code" approach.
Additional autoconfiguration classes are also used and they are listed in the `@ImportAutoConfiguration` annotation.

Autoconfiguration is used as a replacement for JEE deployment descriptor (web.xml).
E.g. servlets and servlet mappings are initialized in the MidPointSpringApplication class.


== SSL Configuration

When using an Embedded Tomcat, you can configure SSL in the `application.yml` file.

.Example
[source]
----
server:
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    keyStoreType: PKCS12
    key-store: /pathToCertificate/certificate.p12
    key-store-password: password
----

This is a basic example, however, you can use other configuration variables.

See also how to link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/ssl.html[configure SSL in Spring Boot].

NOTE: If you are using an untrusted certificate, e.g. self-signed, in addition to referencing it in the keystore, you also need to xref:/midpoint/reference/security/crypto/ssl-connections-client-side-/[import it to the trust store].
