[#_access_to_application]
== Access to application

Access to xref:../objects-and-midpoint/index.adoc#_application[application] is represented in midPoint by assignment of service representing the application.
The application may be assigned directly `user -> application` or indirectly via application roles.

.Example: Access to application - representation in midPoint

Following schema describes the access to application ABC. Access to the application ABC is managed via membership of LDAP groups. One user has access to the application configured directly in the application.

We can interpret such midPoint configuration by technical (IAM) language or by business language.

Technical interpretation (IAM):

* Adam Sangala has role _ABC:Readers_ assigned. Therefore he has account in _LDAP_resource and is assigned in _ABC_R_ LDAP group. He has service _ABC_ assigned.
* Adam Sangala has role _ABC:Readers_ assigned. Therefore he has account in _LDAP_resource and is assigned in _ABC_R_ LDAP group. He has service _ABC_ assigned.
* John Jones has service _ABC_ assigned.

Business interpretation (IGA):

* Adam Sangala has _Reader_ access to application _ABC_ via application role _ABC:Readers_.
* Duro Mokry has _Manager_ access to application _ABC_ via application role _ABC:Managers_.
* John Jones has _Manager_ access to application _ABC_.

.Application access model

Using this structure, access model of the application may be described by displaying direct assignments (or inducements) of the application. Assignment (inducement) relation describes level of the access that the particular role gives to the user.

From the example above we can read that:

* members of _ABC_R_ LDAP group have _Reader_ access level to application ABC,
* members of _ABC_E_ LDAP group have _Editor_ access level to application ABC,
* members of _ABC_M_ LDAP group have _Manager_ access to application ABC,
* user John Jones has _Manager_ access to application ABC.


[#_access_to_application_resource]
== Access to application resource

The xref:../objects-and-midpoint/index.adoc#_application_resource[application resource] increases flexibility of access modelling and enables xref:../parametric-access.adoc[parametric access].

Standard access to application resource is assigned directly with specifying relation. The relation defines level of the access to application resource.
The access may be assigned also via roles (the same as application roles) if needed.

.Example: Access to application resource - representation in midPoint

Following schema describes the access to Confluence space _Direct Hell_. The space is represented by application resource.
Access to the Confluence space is managed via membership of LDAP groups or the space is assigned directly.
Additionally, the schema describes one user being administrator of Confluence.

image:iga-concepts-app-resource-access.png[Application access]

The user access can be described in business (IGA) terminology:

* John Jones has _Editor_ access to Confluence space Direct Hell.
* Duro Mokry has _Reader_ access to Confluence space Direct Hell.

.Application resource access model

By inspecting direct assignments (inducements) to Confluence space Direct Hell we can see who can access it:

* John Jones - directly - access level _Editor_
* members of _dh_readers_ group - access level _Reader_
* members of _dh_editors_ group - access level _Editor_

NOTE: Skilled midPoint engineer may raise the question: "How can midPoint know that John Jones has access to Confluence, if only the LDAP is connected ?". This is legitimate question. This real-life example just explains situations with mixed access - when users are not managed only using defined role objects, but also being assigned directly within the application. +
IGA solution should be able to display this, even when this information is being loaded manually as a result of  e.g. some security audit.

== Application roles vs Business roles

//

== Defining rules - org units and roles
// Pravidla pre pridelenie roly mozu byt riesene bud ako role autoassignment alebo pridelenim roli priamo organizacnej jednotke. V takom pripade je clenom


== Role hierarchy
// - tuto, ze to je struktura na zaklade entitlementov - co ktora rola poskytuje

//== Technical vs. business description of access
//- linka na vrchny dokument a povedat, ze vlastne technicky popis je presne to, co mp aktualne robi a ze business popis je to, co chceme vidiet z pohladu IGA - governance informacia - kto ma pristup kam.
//- technicky popis je vytvorenie uctu na resourci, provisioning systemov
