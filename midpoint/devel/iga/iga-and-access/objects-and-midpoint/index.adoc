Following basic components are used in modelling access in IGA:

[#_application]
== Application
Applications are basic building blocks for defining access. These objects contain business information. Application is an _administrative object_ describing application as a business target that the access relates to. In normal language: Application is "where" in definition of _Where the user has access_.

The application in IGA relates to application or information system in application inventory of the organization (IT Asset inventory according to ITIL).
It may represent application, information system or some data repository where access must be managed.
IGA should not be the source for applications. It should be connected to the application inventory and read the application objects from it.

Application is represented by object `service` in midPoint.

[#_application_resource]
== Application resource
Some applications may have more components where access should be managed. These components are represented by _application resources_.
The application resources can be used to manage dynamically created components in some systems - e.g. shares on file-share server, spaces in confluence.

Instead of applications, the application resources are not linked directly to application inventory, but rather, to application in IGA. Their lifecycle doesn't need to be formalized outside IGA.


Application resources are components of xref:../parametric-access.adoc[parametric access].
Level of the user access (e.g. reader / editor / manager) is defined by the relation in assignment.

_Application resource_ is represented by object `service` in midPoint with specific archetype to distinguish from application.

[#_application_role]
== Application role
Application roles are basic roles. They are related to applications. The application roles are integrating technical components for creation of user access with business description of the access. Business users are working with business description from the application roles, IDM system and IDM administrators are working with technical definitions.

The information in application role will be displayed to different audience. To business audience it should be displayed as easy as possible - in business structure.
For example, like on the picture below:

Details for content of an application role are described xref:app-role-design/index.adoc[here].

[#_business_role]
== Business role
Technically, business roles are collections of application and other business roles. It can contain also assignments of application resources or even applications where necessary.

The information in Business role will be displayed to different audience. To business audience it should be displayed as easy as possible - in business structure.
For example, like on the picture below:
