WARNING: This page is a stub, it is a work in progress.

Business use cases and "user stories" for Identity Governance and Administration. The purpose of this document is to guide design activities by providing a list all the practical use cases for inspiration. We do not claim that our implementation will support all of those use cases.

This list is not complete. It is expected that it will be continually updated and

== Access request use cases

This chapter describes use cases pre assignment management by end users using self-service UI.

It does not cover assignment management performed by IDM administrators in administration interface - these operations are performed instantly and does not generate access request and approvals.

.Request new access
- End user requests new access for himself
// also define parameters
- End user requests new access for somebody else
// also define parameters

.Modify existing access
- End user needs to update parameters of the access for himself
// increase validity period or modify other parameter of the access
- End user needs to update parameters of the access for somebody else

.Remove access
- End user wants to remove access for himself
- End user want to request access removal for somebody else

.Other use cases
- Approver needs to approve/reject one request
- Approver needs to approve/reject multiple requests at once
- End user wants to see request approval and processing history.
- Requestor wants to know why the request is not processed yet

// Approver must be able to see

== Automatic role assignment use cases (policies)

#TODO#
// Common user stories requiring some automation of assigning roles - based on rules.

== Role engineering use cases

// High level - ze sluzi na pripravu struktury roli - prepojenie business a technologickej vrstvy - vytvorenie business modelu pre riadenie pristupov v organizacii.

.New role
- creation of an application role
- creation of a business role
- deployment of a new application and creation of new roles for it
- creation of parametric role
//(in solution resolve how to implement in GUI, how to manage role parameters. In use case identify whether we neesd just static parameters, or the parameters should be updated)
- parametric roles in business roles

.Role modification
- modification of business parameters of the role
- modification of provisioning parameters of the role (role recompute required)
- modification of lis of roles assigned in the business role
// probably recompute ? Definitelly different approval workflow needed)

.Role decommissioning
- decommissioning of a role
- decommissioning of an application

.Process management by end user

== Access certification use cases

#TODO#
