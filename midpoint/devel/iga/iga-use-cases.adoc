WARNING: This page is a stub, it is a work in progress.

Business use cases and "user stories" for Identity Governance and Administration. The purpose of this document is to guide design activities by providing a list all the practical use cases for inspiration. We do not claim that our implementation will support all of those use cases.

This list is not complete. It is expected that it will be continually updated.

== Actors

IGA information is consumed by different actors. Starting with end-users, through technical engineers and finishing by business and security managers.

The IGA information must be available to all of them in the form they need.

| Actor
| Form of information
| Information
| Interface

| End user
| Business level
| Typical interaction of end user is self-service - end user needs to request new access, modify his profile and review the access he has assigned already. He needs to see information of individuals - himself or his teammates.

End-user needs the access to be described in business form.
| End user GUI

| Power user
| Business level
| This is typically business manager or any person who is responsible for managing access of others. Additionally, to the operation of typical end-user, he needs to approve access requests, manage his teams and their access and create/modify business roles.

Typically, he needs to obtain the information by viewing object details in business form and some specific reports prepared for their teams.
| End user GUI

| Application engineer
| Business level + technical level (only in definition of his roles)
| Application engineer is end-user in IGA solution with specific privileges. Within role engineering process he creates and manages details of application roles related to his application.

He needs to see these roles, view also technical content of the roles (not XML, just via GUI) and be able to approve requests if he is assigned as an approver of any role.
| #End user GUI?#

| IGA operator
| Business level + technical level
| This is typically helpdesk operator or some IT operator. The person should be able to manage user attributes (e.g.credentials), manage access for the (scope of) users and manage the teams. He needs to process operation over bulk of users.

He needs to operate via GUI.
| Administrator GUI

| IGA administrator / +
IGA engineer
| Both business and technical level + full access to XML details of the objects.
| These users need full access to the system using GUI and other tools. Need to configure IGA system and also data (on request)
| Administrator GUI +
Other tools

| Role manager
| Both business and technical level
| Needs full access to the GUI, to be able to fully view and possibly manage the role data (structure and assignments).
| Administrator GUI

| Security officer / Auditor
| Both business and technical level
| Needs full read access to GUI. Typically, these actors need to see/run reports and user details of specific users.
| Administrator GUI

The meaning of the form of information is as follows:

* Business level - providing information in the form of "user", his "attributes", "application", "role", "access".
* Technical level - technical information of user's "accounts", "entitlements" (assigned objects). Configuration of application role (inducements, archetypes, ...) but displayed in GUI and terminology acceptable to IT users not specified in midPoint.
* XML details - detail deep midPoint configuration. Good midPoint knowledge is needed.

== Use-Cases

#TODO - lepsie specifikovat tento odsek = mozno ze je to by process#
Use cases are defined in following categories:

* *Role engineering and governance* - specific use-cases related to management of roles
* *Access request* -
* *Access certification* -
* *Visibility and reports*

=== Access request use cases

This chapter describes use cases pre assignment management by end users using self-service UI.

It does not cover assignment management performed by IDM administrators in administration interface - these operations are performed instantly and does not generate access request and approvals.

.Request new access
- End user requests new access for himself
// also define parameters
- End user requests new access for somebody else
// also define parameters

.Modify existing access
- End user needs to update parameters of the access for himself
// increase validity period or modify other parameter of the access
- End user needs to update parameters of the access for somebody else

.Remove access
- End user wants to remove access for himself
- End user want to request access removal for somebody else

.Other use cases
- Approver needs to approve/reject one request
- Approver needs to approve/reject multiple requests at once
- End user wants to see request approval and processing history.
- Requestor wants to know why the request is not processed yet

// Approver must be able to see

.Reports
Reports are described in xref:./reporting.adoc#_access_request_process_monitoring[Access request process monitoring].

=== Automatic role assignment use cases (policies)

#TODO#
// Common user stories requiring some automation of assigning roles - based on rules.

=== Role engineering use cases

// High level - ze sluzi na pripravu struktury roli - prepojenie business a technologickej vrstvy - vytvorenie business modelu pre riadenie pristupov v organizacii.

.New role
- creation of an application role
- creation of a business role
- deployment of a new application and creation of new roles for it
//- creation of parametric role
//(in solution resolve how to implement in GUI, how to manage role parameters. In use case identify whether we neesd just static parameters, or the parameters should be updated)
//- parametric roles in business roles

.Role modification
- modification of business parameters of the role
- modification of provisioning parameters of the role (role recompute required)
- modification of lis of roles assigned in the business role
// probably recompute ? Definitelly different approval workflow needed)

.Role decommissioning
- decommissioning of a role
- decommissioning of an application

.Process management by end user
//TODO - co sem ?

=== Access certification use cases

#TODO#

=== Visibility use cases
