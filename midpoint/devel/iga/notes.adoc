== TODO For Discussion

These things need to further discussed:

* End-to-end request tracking.
Track request from the shopping cart (e.g. how the roles were selected), all the way to the finish of the last provisioning operation (e.g. manual operation).

* Manual provisioning, roles, and work processes.
E.g. assigning a group on manual resource.
How do we construct application role for such resource?
