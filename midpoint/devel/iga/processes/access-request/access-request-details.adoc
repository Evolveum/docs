== The access request lifecycle

This chapter describes the access request process by listing its actors, displaying the process schema, and describing each stage of the process and each step that can be performed. The process is designed to handle exceptions manually by IGA administrator.

The process description and schema are simplified to be easily adopted by people. Complexity of exceptions in approvals and implementation is hidden.

Following actors are active in the process:

* *Requestor* - the person, who created the request for role assignment/removal/modification,
* *Requestee* - the person for whom the request is created,
* *Approver* - approves or rejects the requests,
* *IGA administrator* - troubleshoots failed requests.

|Processing
a|The provisioning (or deprovisioning) of individual components is running. If provisioning requires manual operations (ITSM tickets), the process is waiting till all the tickets are resolved. +
If an error appears in the provisioning, then manual intervention of IGA administrator is needed.  He can administratively move then the request to it's final stage - the `Done-Success` (if the intervention was successful) or Done-Failure (if not).

|The request is in the processing stage until all components are successfully provisioned, or IGA admin manually resolved the issue and moved the request forward.

|Access granted

|Request failed
