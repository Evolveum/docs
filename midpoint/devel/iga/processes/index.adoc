When managing access within the framework of IGA, the Role engineering and maintenance, Access request and Access certification are the most important processes.

Role Engineering and maintenance ensures access modeling - creation of an application and a roles within the IGA system, their structuring, maintenance and correct termination at the end of the lifecycle.

Access request deals with assigning access to specific users.

Once the roles have been assigned, the activities in the Access certification process enable its validation and effective removal so that the user has the access he needs for his work.

NOTE: This area will be developed more closely in the future. Some components are being implemented in the near future, some of them (e.g. complex role engineering lifecycle process) need more detailed work to be implemented.
