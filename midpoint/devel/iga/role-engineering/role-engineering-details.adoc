== The role engineering and maintenance lifecycle

This chapter describes details of the role engineering and maintenance process by listing its actors, displaying the process schema, and describing each stage of the process and each step that can be performed. The process is designed to handle exceptions manually by IGA administrator.

The process description and schema are simplified to be easily adopted by people.

Following actors are active in the process:

* *Author* - the person, who created the request for the role
* *Role manager*
* *Approver* - approves or rejects the requests,
* *IGA administrator* - troubleshoots failed requests.
