WARNING: This page is a work in progress.

The IGA system should provide useful IGA information from the data. Especially for external customers (auditors / security officers / business).

.Reporting to database
The reports should be provided for full set of roles or specified structure (objects to be defined by query or list).
All data shall be exportable to csv or created into a reporting database (tables / materialized views) - where the data may be analyzed.

The reporting database is useful solution for preparing pre-computed information out of the data in IGA solution. Authorized users then can use their analytical tools to obtain results they know and need in efficient and repeatable way.

=== What accounts are created by roles? / What entitlements are managed by roles?

Scenario::
A user wants to know on what resources are accounts created by assignment of the role. Or what roles are creating accounts on specific resources.

Actors::
IGA administrator, Role manager

Motivation::
The information may be needed during some troubleshooting or during analysis of roles. Examples:

* IGA administrator is troubleshooting some issue with accounts on some resources and wants minimize the scope to specific roles acting with the resource
* Role manager wants to organize the roles and identify overlapping roles (the roles that perform the same operations).

User Story::
The users should run a report listing all (or specified set of) roles and collecting information of accounts and entitlements that are managed by the roles. The user then analyzes the report by his own means.

#TODO - some example of the report.#

=== Identification of loops in role structure

=== Scheduled running times for reports

Scenario::

Actors::

Motivation::
Reports may take time and resources to be prepared. User does not want to wait to the report to be finished.
Additionally - it also saves resources by preparing the reports only once for all users.
