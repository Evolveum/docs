The Developer's Guide section of wiki provides information for midPoint developers and contributors.
The pages provide guidelines for code structure, programming practices, code organization, etc.

The content is not formally organized now.
It is (more or less) just a set of useful pages. We will try to create some kind of structure as the volume of information grows.
