* *API JavaDoc* describes the interfaces.
These are the things that should be invoked cross-component and cross-subsystem.
Although, not all of the interfaces are yet stable and not all of them are public.
However this gives a nice subset that is still readable.

* *Full JavaDoc* is a javadoc from all midPoint classes.
It is a huge pile.
And many classes belong to internal implementation and should not be used cross-component.
Use at your own risk.
