This page describes the basic structures of xref:../index.adoc[Prism schema].
The concepts described on this page are the basic building blocks of data structures build on top of Prism framework.

== Basic Prism Schema Concepts

Prism schema is based on several fundamental concepts.

=== Object

Prism data are structured in objects.
Objects are supposed to be stand-alone meaningful sets of prism data.
Each object has its unique identifier called simple _object identifier_ or xref:/midpoint/devel/prism/concepts/object-identifier/[OID] for short.

Data type `Object` is an abstract superclass for all prism objects.
It contains the basic structure that the object must have to be passed between system components and stored in the repository.
It defines four basic _properties_, while two of them are somehow special:

[cols="h,1,1"]
|===
|  Property  |  Type  |  Description

|  `oid`
|  string +
(immutable)
|  System-wide immutable primary identifier of an object.
It may be quite long and not human-readable, it usually takes UUID form.
This identifier is not supposed to be displayed to user.
This identifier must be unique in the entire system.
OID is *immutable*.
It cannot be changed.

|  `version`
|  string  +
(read-only)
|  Repository version of an object.
This property contains a version in which this object was read from the repository, fetched from the resource, etc.
It is maintained by the repository system, usually used for optimistic locking purposes.
The version is meant for internal use by the system.
It is usually not displayed to the user at all.
It is not meant to be user-friendly semantic version of an object.


|  `name`
|  PolyString
|  Human-readable, mutable name of the object.
It may be used as an user-friendly identifier (login name, group name), but there is no requirement to do so.
The name should be unique in the respective context of interpretation (with very vague definition of "context of interpretation").
E.g. the name of the `User` objects should be unique in the entire system, active as a username.
The name of the `Shadow` (account) subtype should be unique in the provisioning resource (target system) that it belongs to.
Name may not be human-readable in a sense that it is displayable to a common end-user.
It is indented to be displayed to IDM system administrator.
Therefore it may contain quite an "ugly" structures such as LDAP DN or URL.


|  `description`
|  string
|  Free-form textual description of the object.
It is meant to be displayed to system administrators and advanced users.

|===

In XML form, the `oid` and `versions` should be represented as XML attributes, all the other object items should be represented as XML elements:

[source,xml]
----
<object oid="c04a1e20-2e5f-11eb-a9bb-47bb95f13972" version="123">
    <name>Foo Bar</name>
    <description>This is just a random object</description>
</object>
----

In JSON and YAML forms, all the properties are JSON keys:

[source,json]
----
{
    "object" : {
        "oid" : "c04a1e20-2e5f-11eb-a9bb-47bb95f13972",
        "version" : "123",
        "name" : "Foo Bar",
        "description" : "This is just a random object"
    }
}
----

[source,yaml]
----
object:
    oid: "c04a1e20-2e5f-11eb-a9bb-47bb95f13972"
    version: "123"
    name: "Foo Bar"
    description: "This is just a random object"
----

Objects contain other items, such as _properties_, _containers_ and _references_.
In XML representation the properties are usually the first-level elements in Object XML body, in JSON representatiotion they are usually keys of the top-level hashmap and so on.

=== Property

Property is a specific data characteristic of an object.
It may be considered to be object "attribute" or "field".
For example `User` has `fullName` property that contains string value of user's full name.

* Properties may be single-valued or multi-valued.

* Properties are usually of a primitive type, such as string or integer.
However, in some cases, the properties may be structured (a.k.a "complex types").

* Property values are unordered.
The implementation does not guarantee ordering of values.
Prism framework, data stores or any other component may reorder the values if needed.

* Duplicate values are not allowed.
Duplicate values of properties are usually silently removed by implementations.
However, clients must be able to tolerate presence of duplicate values.

Operations that modify the objects work with the granularity of properties.
They add/remove/replace the values of properties, but cannot "reach" inside the properties when modifying them.
The xref:/midpoint/devel/prism/concepts/deltas/[deltas] do not "see" inside the property.

=== Container

Containers group properties into logical blocks, creating a hierarchical data structure.
The reason for grouping may be as simple as better understandability of data structure.
Because containers can, just like properties, be single-valued or multi-valued, it is important
to distinguish between _container_ and _container **value**_, although in speach this distinction is
often lost.

_Container value_ contains a set of (potentially multi-valued) properties.
The order of properties in a container is not significant (not even in XML representation).

Following examples demonstrate the use of single-value `activation` container,
which contains a single `administrativeStatus` property:

[source,xml]
----
<object oid="c04a1e20-2e5f-11eb-a9bb-47bb95f13972">
    <name>Foo Bar</name>
    <activation>
        <administrativeStatus>enabled</administrativeStatus>
    </activation>
</object>
----

[source,json]
----
{
    "object" : {
        "oid" : "c04a1e20-2e5f-11eb-a9bb-47bb95f13972",
        "name" : "Foo Bar",
        "activation" : {
            "administrativeStatus" : "enabled"
        }
    }
}
----

[source,yaml]
----
object:
    oid: "c04a1e20-2e5f-11eb-a9bb-47bb95f13972"
    name: "Foo Bar"
    activation:
        administrativeStatus: "enabled"
----

==== Multi-value containers

Single-value containers are easy - the value is there or not.
With Multi-value containers we often need to point at specific value from many.
It is possible to use some equivalence strategy, see https://github.com/Evolveum/prism/blob/master/infra/prism-api/src/main/java/com/evolveum/midpoint/prism/equivalence/EquivalenceStrategy.java[EquivalenceStrategy] and
xref:/midpoint/projects/midprivacy/phases/01-data-provenance-prototype/processing/model/comparing-values/index.adoc[notes about comparing values].

But sometimes we need to identify one specific container value even when it changes - we want it to
have an identifier.
And each Prism container indeed has an integer identifier.
This way we can identify one concrete container value, e.g. assignment with the item path like `assignment/4`.

[NOTE]
Container identifier is always used in the context of the container so technically it would suffice
if it was unique inside the container only.
Current repository implementations however use object-wide unique identifier and also avoid reusing
previously used containers (except when replacing values in a single operation).
Generally, this should not bother users except when they try to assign container identifiers when
importing object - which is not recommended anyway.
See also further notes in xref:/midpoint/devel/prism/concepts/deltas/#object-modifyadd-delta[Prism Deltas, ADD modification].

=== Object Reference

`Object Reference` is an item which describes a reference from one object to another object.
Reference is used to represent an association between objects, for example, a reference from a `User` object to `Role` object that the user has assigned.
The reference is a simple uni-directional link that uses an OID as an identifier.

[source,xml]
----
<object oid="c04a1e20-2e5f-11eb-a9bb-47bb95f13972">
    <name>Foo Bar</name>
    <linkRef oid="fb3739a4-2e65-11eb-a925-93f2d815be4a" type="ShadowType"/>
</object>
----

[source,json]
----
{
    "object" : {
        "oid" : "c04a1e20-2e5f-11eb-a9bb-47bb95f13972",
        "name" : "Foo Bar",
        "likRef" : {
            "oid" : "fb3739a4-2e65-11eb-a925-93f2d815be4a",
            "type" : "ShadowType"
        }
    }
}
----

[source,yaml]
----
object:
    oid: "c04a1e20-2e5f-11eb-a9bb-47bb95f13972"
    name: "Foo Bar"
    linkRef:
        oid: "fb3739a4-2e65-11eb-a925-93f2d815be4a"
        type: "ShadowType"
----

The reference has several attributes:

[cols="h,1,1"]
|===
|  Attribute  |  Type  |  Description

|  `oid`
|  string
|  Target object OID.
OID of the object that this reference refers to.

|  `type`
|  QName +
(optional)
|  Target object type.
Data type of the object that this reference refers to.
It must be used for references where target object type is not specified in the schema.
If the type is specified in the schema, use of `type` attribute in the reference is optional.

|===


== Extensibility

Prism objects have an extensibility mechanism.
The objects can be enriched by custom data items.

The objects have special `extension` element where custom data items can be placed.

[source,xml]
----
<object oid="c04a1e20-2e5f-11eb-a9bb-47bb95f13972">
    <name>Foo Bar</name>
    <extension>
        <foo>bar</foo>
    </activation>
</object>
----

[source,json]
----
{
    "object" : {
        "oid" : "c04a1e20-2e5f-11eb-a9bb-47bb95f13972",
        "name" : "Foo Bar",
        "extension" : {
            "foo" : "bar"
        }
    }
}
----

[source,yaml]
----
object:
    oid: "c04a1e20-2e5f-11eb-a9bb-47bb95f13972"
    name: "Foo Bar"
    extension:
        foo: "bar"
----

TODO: sample of extension schema definition

NOTE: Historically, the extensible part was "quarantined" into the `extension` element to avoid problems with XSD unique particle attribution (UPA) rule.
The `extension` element is still used, mostly to avoid conflicts of custom items with static schema items.
However, the `extension` is likely to be optional in future versions of Prism framework.



== Prism Schema Definition

Prism schema is traditionally specified in a form of XML Schema Definition (XSD) language.
However, the capabilities of XSD are quite limited and extension of XSD with custom annotations has its limits.
Therefore, there is an ongoing effort to migrate Prism to xref:/midpoint/axiom/[Axiom], a new modeling language for abstract data structures.

=== XSD Schema Annotations

Currently, the Prism schema is specified in XSD format.
However, prism schema is richer than the stock XSD format can describe.
Therefore the Prism schema definition is using a lot of XSD annotations.
Some of the annotatiotions are described in following sections.

==== container

Annotation that specifies that the data item or data type is _prism container_.

=== object

Annotation that the data item or data type is _prism object_.

=== displayName

Specifies the printable name of the object class or attribute.
It must contain a printable string.

This is supposed to be an annotation of a _container_ or _property_ definitions.

=== help

Specifies the help text, or a key to catalog file for a help text.
The help text may be displayed in any suitable way by the GUI.
It should explain the meaning of a definition.
Usually applies to a property, but may also apply to other definitions.


=== targetType

The target type of an object reference.
This annotation may appear in object reference type definitions and specify a valid XSD object types whose may be the targets of the reference.
