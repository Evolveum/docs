| Notes

| Create new business role
| 1
| IGA Administrator or Business user
| -> Draft
a| Starting new business role wizard in GUI.

This start may be also done via some more complex operations (e.g. create copy of a business role).

| Create candidate role in role mining
| 2
| IGA Administrator
| -> Draft
a| Creation of new candidate role in role mining.

| Tune and review candidate role
| 3
| IGA Administrator or Business user
| Draft
a|Editing the content of the role. +
Running through the wizard or oepning individual tiles of already configured role and performing modification of :

    - attributes
    - application roles
    - governance (owners, approvers) / approval policies
    - proposed members (not yet implemented)
    - other (induced roles, ...)

Content of the role may be edited and modified by different people and in iterations. Role should be kept in this stage until intentionally and explicitly moved further.

Users may get back to the role and continue filling the details when they collect necessary information.

NOTE: Documentation of required changes (some TODOs). How to do it ? Cases ?

| Button: "Review business impact"

| Review business impact
|
| Business user
| Draft
a| Panel displaying actual modifications of the role object and impact on other assignments - business view.

* Role modifications
* Changes of assignments (direct and indirect) +
"Following roles and access will be added, following roles and access will be removed. Role will be assigned to following users."

No user attribute changes here. If we display attributes we should display also accounts. It would be too complicated.
