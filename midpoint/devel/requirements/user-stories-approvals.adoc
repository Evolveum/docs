This document contains user stories for upgrade of design of approvals.
It is prepared for planning of development of *midPoint version 4.9*. Some user stories described here may be already implemented.

This document will be tuned during summer 2023.


== User experience

=== Improving User Understanding of Approvals

Currently, our approval process includes too much midpoint-specific terminology, such as "delta," which may not be familiar or intuitive to our business users. To enhance the user experience, we should make the approvals more user-friendly and align them with concepts that business users are already familiar with, namely "requests" and "approvals."

In the context of midpoint, we can adopt the following naming convention:

* *Request:* This will replace the "Top level case" to represent the initial user request for approval.
* *Case:* This term will continue to be used in midpoint, representing the approval process for each request.
* *Workitem:* represents the individual tasks or items requiring approval within a case.

Furthermore, we should ensure that all user-facing pages hide the midpoint-specific terminology, presenting a more intuitive interface for business users. The goal is to provide approvers with a clear and straightforward view of the requests they are handling, enabling better communication and collaboration among all parties involved in the approval process.

User story::
AS a business manager who does not know midpoint terminology but needs to approve, +
I WANT TO have clear intuitive understanding what is request, case and who has to approve it and when, +
SO THAT I won't get lost in GUI without learning midpoint terminology. I want just to see and understand things I need to approve and use approvals to approve or reject the requests.

=== Attachment / link in the request
The attachment may be assigned by requestor or even by approver.

User story::
AS an end user requesting access +
I WANT TO be able to attach attachment to the request (e.g. email from some manager), or add a link to some other system (website) +
SO THAT I can prove reason of my request. +

User story::
AS an approver approving request +
I WANT TO be able to attach attachment to the request, or add a URL link +
SO THAT I can explain better my decision, or
THAT I can provide requestor or next approvers some additional information.

=== Send back to requestor

User Story::
AS an Approver +
I WANT the ability to send a request back to requestor for additional information +
SO THAT I can obtain the necessary details or clarifications required for a complete and accurate evaluation of the request.

Acceptance Criteria::
* When the request is sent back, the requestor should be notified.
* The status of the request should be appropriately updated to reflect the "information requested" state.
* Midpoint should allow the requestor to update and resubmit the request after providing the requested information or modify it.

=== Automatic approval if requestor = approver

AS an engineer configuring approvals, +
I WANT TO configure request to be approved automatically when requestor is the same as approver, +
SO THAT users don't experience unnecessary approvals.

Acceptance Criteria::
* The IAM engineer configuring approvals should have an option to enable such automatic approval.
* The automatic approval should be applied in any step of the approval.
* When the automatic approval feature is enabled, midPoint should check if the requestor is the same as the approver at any stage of the approval process.
* If the requestor is the same as the approver, the request should be automatically approved without any additional steps.
* The IAM engineer configuring approvals should be able to disable the automatic approval feature for specific types of requests or stages, providing flexibility in the approval setup.
* The automatic approval should be logged in the history of apprvovals with itentification of automatic approval.

=== #Better overview of the approval case#

Approver must have better overview of what is he approving. The user interface for approver should be redesigned.

Better user interface is necessary, some high level description of the operation like we have in audits can help. New user interface

#TODO - more details?#

.Discussion chain from approval notes.

Approval notes should be visible in a chain - that each approver will be able to read and understand.

Notes for redesign :

* less tabs and objects
* create chain of approval notes - to see the discussion
* displaying of chain of actions - who, when, result, note
* status of the request



=== New manager - access to historical data

User Story::
AS a IAM administrator or engineer, +
I WANT TO ensure that when a manager is replaced, the new manager can access the historical data of requests, cases and workitems associated with the previous manager, +
SO THAT changes of managers will not break approval processes and new manager can continue in the work of the previous one.

Acceptance criteria::

. When a new manager takes over, he/she should have the necessary permissions in midPoint to access historical records of their predecessor's activities and decisions.
. The access to the historical data should be controlled by complex computation of authorization (more resource intensive) or by administrative procedure (requires additional automated or manual operation).
. midPoint should provide option to keep or remove access to historical data by old manager.
. The configuration of the definition should be well documented with examples provided.
. The solution in midPoint should be scalable and efficient, allowing for smooth access to historical data even in cases of frequent manager changes.


=== Approve on behalf of

The concept of "attorney" does not align well with business context in many organizations. Commonly used terms are "deputy" and "on behalf of." The term "attorney" is not a widely recognized business term and should be replaced.

User Story::
AS a deputy of an Approver +
I WANT TO be able to perform approvals on his/her behalf, +
SO THAT requests will not be delayed if the approver is unavailable.

Acceptance Criteria::

. I should have the authorization to act as a deputy approver for the specific approver.
. When the authorized approver is not available, I can perform approvals on their behalf.
. End user should see that the approval was performed by me as the deputy approver (on behalf of).
. Requests should continue to be processed and not wait for the approver's presence, ensuring timely approvals even in their absence.
. midPoint should display information that the request was approved by <my name> on behalf of <the original approver>.
. Term "attorney" should not be used in GUI.

=== Approving specific changes of specific users (VIP users).

How to handle situation when I want to approve modification of specific attributes for specific people. Typically such people is top management of the organization.

User Story::
AS an IAM Administrator, +
I WANT the ability to approve modifications of specific attributes or assignments for certain individuals coming from authoritative sources, +
SOTHAT I can control and validate changes made to critical data for the designated users.

Example::

* The email attribute comes from source system to midPoint. I want to approve modification of email attribute for top management. To be sure that top management won't get email change.

Acceptance Criteria::

. midPoint should allow to specify rules (policy rules, "mapping policy rules" ?) for approving modification of specific attributes or assignments of specific users. +
This is already possible, just configuration si very complex and resource intensive. See below.
. IAM administrator should easily identify such attributes and approval rules
. When IAM administrator decides to reject the modification, the subsequent reconciliations should not trigger additional approval requests until the source attribute is changed again
    ** maybe we can use shadow marks for this
. The approval should be auditable
. IAM administrator should be notified about the requested approval
. When the modification is rejected, the "rule of not using authoritative value" should be created.
. IAM administrator can easily list, identify and manage such rules
. When situation changes, IAM administrator can delete the "rule of not using authoritative value" and modification can be applied to the user. Or approval is raised again and IAM administrator can approve it.
. The configuration should be well documented prepared with examples for engineers.

NOTE: In the version 4.7, the policy probably rules allows such configuration using extension attribute to be filled from inbound source and mapping defined in object template. Just the solution requires additional extension attribute, increasing perfomance requirements (new global policy rule) and not providing all features defined in acceptance criteria above.

== Big picture / reporting over requests and approvals

=== Request analysis

User Story::
AS a Role Manager / IAM Operations Manager / Security Officer +
I WANT TO obtain big picture information about requests and their approvals +
SO THAT I can effectively manage IAM operations and also processes related to it.

Particularly:

* I want to know which roles are most frequently requested for a given period, so that I can optimize rule configurations and automate assignments.
* I want to identify requests that required most approvers, so that I can address any inefficiencies or bottlenecks.
* I want to identify requests with the longest approval times, so that I can investigate and address any delays in the approval process within the organization.
* I want to track the total number of requests created and the average approval time for each request, including the time taken for 90% or 95% of the requests to be approved.
    ** Monitoring average is not enough. Managing 90% or 95% level is much better (90%: 9 of 10 requests will be processed withing this time iterval.)
* I want to perform these statistics separately for different types of requests, without mixing them together.

=== Manual request processing

User Story::
AS a Role Manager / IAM Operations Manager / Security Officer +
I WANT TO monitor not only apprroval phase but also provisioning as well +
SO THAT I can verify that request are fully fulfilled and they did not fail during provisioning.

=== Compare trends

User Story::
AS a Role Manager / IAM Operations Manager +
I WANT TO see statistics from specific request analysis for time periods +
SO THAT I can identify trends and manage processes.

=== Better overview of my requests in GUI

User story::
AS a user +
I WANT TO see my open requests and their status (who is currently approving them and since when) +
SO THAT I can contact the person and request approval, enabling a self-service approach for problem-solving.

User story::
AS a user +
I WANT TO know how long a specific person has had my request (whether they received it yesterday or if it's been a week) +
SO THAT I can be aware of the approval timeline and follow up if necessary.

User Story::
As a User +
I WANT TO see all my requests that I have created together with their status +
SO THAT I can see a list of all requests that I have created since I joined the system. For each request I want to be able to track its progress.

=== Better view of open requests in user (object)

User story::
AS business user +
I WANT TO see easier that user (myself) or other object has open requests/cases when I open the object +
SO THAT I won't miss that user (or myself) has something "in progress" and therefore may not be applied in his access yet.

The notification is already visible over the cases, but business user can miss it quite often. Something better visible, but not very aggressive - not necessary to click on it.


== REST interface

=== Approval via REST

Midpoint must have options to approve/reject requests via REST.

User story::
AS an IT manager+
I WANT TO all requests were approved in our internal tool +
SO THAT people (managers) can perform their basic daily approval tasks from one place - the same environment and see what they approved and when.

Acceptance criteria::
GIVEN company has its own application that is used for performing approve/reject operations. This application can connect to midpoint via REST. +
WHEN an approver has to approve request +
THEN the application is able to show request with basic information (what was requested, when, who, approval notes). User is able to approve, reject the request (together with writing the note). +
If the user needs more details, he is able to get directly to midpoint via link.

We need to resolve issue listed already in xref:../../guides/approvals-via-rest-howto/index.adoc[Approvals via REST howto]

See also: xref:https://jira.evolveum.com/browse/MID-6067[JIRA MID-6067]


The application may not necessarily mimic all the details provided in midpoint. If user needs more info, the link should be available to get to approval case in midpoint.


== IAM Engineer experience

The updates in 4.9 should provide better interface to engineer. It should provide easier configuration and better overview of what is already configured in the system. So the engineer is more efficient and inexperienced engineers can get into midPoint faster.

=== Default configuration of notifications

User Story::
AS an engineer configuring approvals and it's notifications, +
I WANT TO have default or initial configurations available that I can use as a starting point for my own configurations, +
SO THAT I can expedite the process of setting up approvals and notifications and deliver my results faster.


*Acceptance Criteria*

Default configuration of notifications should provide following notifications:

Notifications to requestor:

* When the request is created: "Your request of assigning role XYZ was created."
    ** optionally, if requestee is not the same as requestor: "Request of assigning role XYZ to you was created by <requestors name>."
* At the end of the approval, when all approvals are done and the request is approved: "You request of assigning role XYZ was approved"
    ** alternatively, when the request is rejected: "Your request was rejected"

Notifications to approver:

* Notifications to approver: "Your approval is required for ..."

Optional notification to requestor:

* When the request is sent back to requestor, then the requestor should obtain notification: "Your request was returned to you by <name>"


=== Cover also manual tasks in the request workflow

#TODO# - when there are manual cases required in provisioning of the task, then


=== Workflow / lifecyle definition

#TODO# - engineer is able to define workflow using stages and transitions in UI.
