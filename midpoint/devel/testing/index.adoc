Testing any non-trivial product is always a complex task and we do not claim to have all the bases covered.
But midPoint is tested extensively, mostly using automated tests based on frameworks link:https://testng.org/doc/[TestNG] (with Spring testing extensions) and link:https://selenide.org/[Selenide].

These automated tests cover many scenarios - and also documents them, although not necessarily on a level readable by analyst.

Check wiki:Unit+Tests[Unit Tests] for most elemental tests and then check wiki:Integration+Tests[Integration Tests]. Both types of tests use TestNG and all the tests extend from our subclasses providing basic facilities.
