This page provides a guidelines for testing midPoint in "feature freeze" stage.
This is usually the stage when all the features are implemented and roughly tested.
This state begins few weeks before midPoint release.
This is the time when all feature development is stopped and intense testing and bugfixing takes place.
This state lasts for a few weeks and ends with midPoint release.

Any bugs identified during this stage will be most likely fixed in the immediate midPoint release.
Any bugs identified after that release will be fixed in the next release (unless a midPoint subscriber asks for a backport) - which is usually approx.
6 months later.
Therefore anyone interested in using midPoint is strongly advised to take part in the pre-release testing after midPoint feature freeze.
