Exercise tips:

Entitlements and gensync:
groups automatically created for job codes
roles automatically created for "team" LDAP groups

MEDIUM:

* Archetypes(employee,project,division), view(active employees), assignment relation,


* provisioning dependencies?
* provisioning scripts (e.g. create homedir, powershell/exchange?)

* pre-create and delayed account deletion

* Role catalog, simple approvals, notifications
* Simple SoD

* Manual connector
* Password hashing, account initialization
* Password policy, check exception (e.g. custom password dictionary, must not contain username)
* Self-service password reset
* Self-service registration

* Bulk action: recompute active employees, executed manually

* Recertification campaign

* Setup custom logo in GUI
* Custom columns in user list
* Custom data in summary panel

HARD:

Governed Identities:
* meta-meta-roles
* Role autoassignment with assignment subtype (mapping domain/range): same role can be assigned from HR and manually from GUI.
* approvals, many levels, optional security officer approval, escalations
* policy rules in metaroles/archetypes
* custom user-friendly policies (e.g. approval by security officer)
* SoD with "class" metaroles
* "Radio button roles"
* global policy rules
* role lifecycle and approvals (approve create, modify and delete role)
** Role catalog with "application" (archetypes), application owner has to approve creation/modification of a new role
* add-hoc recertification
* Deputy
* Function libraries
* GUI value validation (check that email and telephone number is well-formed)
* Full-text search
* Bulk action with Groovy script: TODO: what it should do?
* Launch bulk actions from object menu
* Bulk action in scheduled task: TODO: what it should do?
* Change encryption keys, re-encrypt the values (Bulk task)

* Semi-manual connector

* Assignment parameters (parametric roles)

* Cluster: multi-node tasks

* Personas

LDAP Posix Account
* Sequences for uidNumber and gidNumber
* Auxiliary object classes -> LDAP?
* Both LDAP groups and posix groups

Overlay project
* post-initial objects
* Custom form (java)
* Custom service
* Custom task handler

Custom fields in audit log, custom dashboard based on audit log
