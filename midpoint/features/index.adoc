MidPoint is a comprehensive and feature-rich platform.
It has numerous features, that are even difficult to completely enumerate.
However, we have tried to do our best, enumerating the features:

* xref:unique/[Unique Features of MidPoint]
* xref:current/[List of All Current Features]

MidPoint is also a vibrant project, with very active development.
Therefore new features are added all the time.
Before a feature is added, there is usually a simple description of the functionality.
Following pages list such description:

* xref:planned/[Planned Features]

Features are planned, developed, supported, deprecated and removed, following a predictable xref:/midpoint/versioning/feature-lifecycle/[feature lifecycle model].
