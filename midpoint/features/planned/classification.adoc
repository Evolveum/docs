= Classification Improvements
:page-toc: top
:page-upkeep-status: yellow

== Introduction

xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/policies/classification/[Classification and clearance management] is part of midPoint since 4.8.3.
Current implementation is based solely on pre-existing concepts of feature:meta-role[meta-roles] and feature:policy-rule[policy rules].
The basic functionality works, however it is not very convenient.
Perhaps the most obvious problem is a lack of visibility and user-friendliness.

== Improvements

We need to improve:

* There is no visibility, the classifications (labels) are not easy to see, even when they are assigned directly.
We need to do:

** Find a prominent place to display the classifications (labels), e.g. in object details header.

** Display classifications in object details panels, perhaps as top-level item in the panel submenu.

** Display application classifications (maybe role classficiation) on important places when the application/role is displayed.
E.g. show classification level in approval dialog, to provide information to approver.

** Better visibility of pre-define "Privileged Access" classification - even if assigned indirectly.
We want to highlight roles that include privileged access.

** Compute classifications for roles, using inducements.
See xref:/midpoint/devel/design/compliance/[] for discussion.

* Error messages and overall presentation of policy rule violations.
Current error message looks like:
+
`No assignment exists for role 09360ff0-d506-4751-b13f-4e01422693ac (after operation)`
+
Overall, the presentation of policy rule violations should be re-thought and significantly improved.

* Improve policy rule structure and operation.
Currently, we are using `hasNoAssignment` policy constraint.
It works, but the notation is not very intuitive.
It should be changed to be more like `exclusion`, with similar behavior.
Perhaps `hasNoAssignment` should be changed to `requirement`, or even better, new flexible `requirement` constraint should be added in addition to existing `hasNoAssignment`.
Current `hasNoAssignment` constraint triggers too aggressively.
E.g. even in case where both classified role and clearance are removed.the policy rule prohibits the operation even though it is legal.

* Show classifications (labels) in application list (view), add new column.
How to compute value of that column?
This is likely to be quite a common requirement.
