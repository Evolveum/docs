:page-description: Scheduling single-run tasks is a possible feature for future releases of midPoint.
:page-keywords: tasks, scheduling

== Motivation

You can xref:/midpoint/reference/tasks/task-manager/#task-scheduling[schedule recurring tasks] in midPoint already.
However, it's not possible to schedule single-run tasks, such as an import from a resource.
The possibility to schedule single-run tasks could open further options to efficient resource management, such as creating a demanding single-run task during the regular business hours and scheduling it for later when the systems are not as busy with their usual daily workload.
