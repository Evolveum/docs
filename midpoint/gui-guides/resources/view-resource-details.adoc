To display resource details, list resource objects, or import resource objects:

* Click the resource name in the resource list (available under Resources tab).
  A new page will be displayed for the selected resource.

The information is organized as follows: Details, Defined Tasks, Accounts, Entitlements, Generics, Uncategorized, Connector.

At the bottom of each section are buttons:
* Back to go back to the resource list.
* Test Connection to check if the connection to the Resource system is successfully established.
* Refresh Schema to refresh changes in schema.
* Edit Configuration to modify configuration properties.
* Show Using Wizard to display resource definition in wizard format.
* Edit Using Wizard to modify resource definition through a wizard.
* Edit XML to edit the resource definition in XML format using an embedded editor.

The Details pane displays basic information about the resource:
* Connector name, status, and version
* Basic information about resource configuration and objects that can be managed on this resource (e.g., accounts, groups, LDAP object classes).

The Defined Tasks pane displays tasks related to that resource.

The Accounts section lists accounts in the repository and on the resource system with a summary table.
It also offers options for filtering accounts according to any attribute and executing account operations such as Import, Delete, Enable/Disable account, and Remove/Change owner.
At the bottom of this section are options for creating tasks.

The Entitlements pane and Generics pane contain similar sections as the Accounts pane but for other objects (groups, projects, etc.).
Objects in these panes are categorized by intent.

The Uncategorized pane offers an option to filter Repository/Resource objects according to Object Class.

The Connector pane displays information about the used connector.
