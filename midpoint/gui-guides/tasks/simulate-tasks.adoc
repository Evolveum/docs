Task simulation is a powerful feature in midPoint that allows administrators to preview changes before they are applied to the system or resources. This helps ensure that any modifications or configurations will behave as expected without causing unintended consequences.

== What is Task Simulation?

Simulation, also known as "preview mode," enables you to run tasks and see what changes would be made if the task were executed in real-time. It's particularly useful for testing new mappings, synchronization reactions, or other configuration changes before applying them to your production environment.

== Why Use Task Simulation?

There are several reasons why using simulation is beneficial:

. Risk Mitigation: Avoid unintended changes by previewing the effects of a task.
. Testing Configurations: Test new configurations without affecting live data.
. Debugging: Identify issues in mappings or reactions before they impact your system.

== How to Use Task Simulation via GUI

To use task simulation, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the Tasks section from the main menu.
. Select the specific resource for which you want to run a simulation task (e.g., HR System).
. Click on New Task.
. Choose the type of task you wish to simulate (e.g., Import, Reconciliation).

=== Execution Settings

When creating or editing a task, you can configure it to run in simulation mode by adjusting the execution settings:

. Execution Mode: Select Preview from the dropdown menu under the "Execution" tab.
		.. This ensures that no actual changes are made; only simulated results will be shown.

. Configuration to Use:
		.. Choose between Development or Production.
		.. The Development configuration allows you to test new configurations without affecting your production setup.

=== Viewing Simulation Results

After running a simulation task, the results can be viewed in several ways:

. Simulation Result Object: A new object will be created that contains details of what changes would have been made.
. Task Details Page:
		.. Navigate to the Tasks section and find your recently run simulation task.
		.. Click on the task name to view detailed results, including any metrics or event marks.

=== Creating Reports

You can also generate reports from simulation results:

. Go to the Reports section in the main menu.

. Select a report template (e.g., Simulation Report: Items Changed).

. Configure the report parameters:
		.. Choose the relevant simulation result object.
		.. Customize other settings as needed.

. Run the report and export it to CSV or another format for further analysis.

== Conclusion

Task simulation in midPoint is an essential tool for administrators who want to ensure that their configurations and changes will work correctly before applying them to live systems. By using the GUI, you can easily set up simulations without needing to delve into XML configurations, making it accessible even for those with less technical expertise.

For more detailed information on configuring tasks via XML, refer to the official midPoint documentation.

== Read the Simulation Results

// This needs to go to its dedciated section once it exists

You run simulated tasks to confirm your configuration behaves as expected.
To see the results of the simulated task:

. Open the corresponding resource via icon:database[] *Resources* > icon:database[] *All resources*.
. In icon:tasks[] Defined Tasks, click the task the results of which you want to inspect.
. Click btn:[Show simulation results] at the top.

Here, you can see tiles with an overview of what would have happened.
Click the btn:[More info] buttons to view the affected objects.
The left sidebar shows an overview of object counts.
Click the numbers to list the objects and see more details.
