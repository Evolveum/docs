Every system you want to connect to midPoint is represented as a resource in midPoint. To connect a system, you need to create a resource for it first. This guide shows you how to create a new resource in midPoint and configure to access the resource.

In this guide, we assume you have no templates from which to create a resource.

To start simple, you'll learn how to connect a CSV resource. That is, to read data from a CSV file saved in the midPoint home directory.

== Create new resource

. In Administration > Resources, click *New Resource*.
. Click *From Scratch*.
. Select a connector. To read a CSV file, use *CsvConnector*.

Now, you'll configure the resource on several screens.

=== 1. Basic Information
. Type *Name* and *Description* of the resource. For example,
    * Name: _HRIS_
    * Description: _CSV exports from the HR system_
. Keep the *Lifecycle state* as _Proposed_.

=== 2. Establish a Connection

For CSV connector, the only configuration is a path to the source CSV file.
The exact path depends on your midPoint instance configuration as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

Look for the `volumes:` configuration to figure you the right path to use here.
It could be, for example:

* `/opt/midpoint/var/resources/export.csv`
* `/home/myname/midpoint-tests/midpoint_home/hrexport.csv`

[TIP]
--
MidPoint validates the path when you try to get to the next step, ie., _Discovery_.
If the path is OK, it lets you proceed.
If it's not OK, midPoint will tell you and won't let you go on.

=== 3. MidPoint Discovery

Use this screen to tell midPoint about your data structure.
Refer to the information tooltip icons to learn about the purpose of the individual fields.

In the case of CSV, make sure you set the delimiter and quotes right.

Importantly, you need to select a *name of the unique attribute*, .ie., an attribute that uniquely identifies each entry in your database.

Conveniently, midPoint suggests the field names so that you don't need to type them manually.

=== 4. Schema of Object Types

In the final screen, you select the schema of the object types that are in the resource.

If you're connecting an HR or similar resource where the objects are people (users), *use the pre-selected _AccountObjectClass_ schema*.

Otherwise, you need to extend the schema or create a custom one. Refer to the xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-schema/[resource schema documentation] for details.

Click *Create Resource* to finish the configuration.

== What's next?

With the resource created, there are two things to do next:

. Preview the resource data. Use this to confirm midPoint gets from the resource the data correctly.
. Configure object types. You need to do this to tell midPoint what the objects in the resource contain and how to work with them.
