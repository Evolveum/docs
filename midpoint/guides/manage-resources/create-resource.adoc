Every system you want to connect to midPoint is represented as a resource in midPoint.
To connect a system, you need to create a resource for it first.
This guide shows you how to create a new resource in midPoint and configure to access the resource.

In this guide, we assume you don't have any templates from which to create a resource.

== Create New Resource

. In Resources, click *New Resource*.
. Click *From Scratch*.
. Select a connector.
    For example, to read a CSV file, use the *CsvConnector*.

Now, you'll configure the resource on several screens.

=== 1. Basic Information
. Type *Name* and *Description* of the resource. +
    For example,
    * Name: _HRIS_
    * Description: _CSV exports from the HR system_
. Keep the *Lifecycle state* as _Proposed_ until you finish and test the configuration of the resource.

=== 2. Establish a Connection

Now, you need to provide information on how to connect to the resource.

In the case of the CSV connector, the only configuration required is the path to the source CSV file.
The exact path depends on your midPoint instance configuration as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

Look for the `volumes:` configuration to figure out the right path to use here.
It may be, for example, `/opt/midpoint/var/resources/export.csv`.

For remote resources such as LDAP servers, the configuration is more complex.
Refer to the documentation of the particular connector you're using.

[TIP]
--
MidPoint validates the configuration before you can get to the next step.
If the configuration is correct, you can proceed.
If midPoint can't connect to the resource, it'll tell you so and won't let you continue.

=== 3. MidPoint Discovery

Use this screen to tell midPoint about your data structure.
Refer to the information tooltip icons to learn about the purpose of each field.

Importantly and regardless of the resource type, you need to *select a name of the unique attribute*, i.e., an attribute that uniquely identifies each entry in your database.

.Conveniently, midPoint suggests the field names so that you don't need to type them manually. Here, they're columns found in a CSV file.

=== 4. Schema of Object Types

In the final screen, you select the schema of the object types that are in the resource.

If you're connecting an HR or similar resource where the objects are people (users), *use the pre-selected _AccountObjectClass_ schema*.

Otherwise, you need to extend the schema or create a custom one. Refer to the xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-schema/[resource schema documentation] for details.

Click *Create Resource* to finish the configuration.

== Next Steps

With the resource created, there are two things to do next:

. *Preview the resource data*.
    Use this to confirm midPoint gets from the resource the data correctly. +
    If you need to access the resource configuration later:
    .. In Resources > All resources, select the resource.
    .. In the left-side resource navigation, these are the sections you'll use the most in the beginning: +
        *Basic*, *Connector configuration*, and *Resource objects*.

. xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/[*Configure object types*].
    You need to do this to tell midPoint what the objects in the resource contain and how to work with them.

Once you configure the object type, you can import users from the resource to midPoint.
