Resources represent applications and information systems connected to midPoint, where resource accounts should be managed.

To create, modify, or delete resources:

* Click the _Resources - List resources_ tab.
  A list of resources is displayed in a table with some basic attributes: Name (in midPoint), Connector type, Version (of the connector), and the basic options icons.

You can sort the resource list by name by clicking on the table column header. If you click the same column again, you can select whether the sorting should be ascending or descending.

For more information, refer to the xref:/connectors/[Resource and Connector Reference] chapter.
