== Resource Definition

Resource definition is perhaps the most important part of midPoint configuration. It configures connection to a resource, resource object classes and attributes (resource schema), mapping of these attributes to the midPoint object model, resource capabilities, password policies, etc.

Resource definition is an ordinary XML object in midPoint repository. Therefore it has its OID and a name that must be unique across all defined resources.
You can check this by clicking through the path Configuration-Resources from List objects - a resource of your choice from the list of available resources.

=== Resource Configuration Object Composition

* *Connector Reference*: Refers to the specific connector used for accessing the resource. Either an OID reference to a connector object or a smart reference to a connector type is required.
  The list of available connectors is in xref:/connectors/connectors/[Identity Connectors] chapter. This list is not closed; we can produce a proper connector tailored for your target systems.

* *Resource Configuration*: The connector specified by resource `connectorRef` is just code. For the connector to work properly, it needs configuration.
  Such configuration includes details like the name of the host where the resource resides, TCP/IP port number, technical account used to connect, password for that account, database table name, directory root, filenames, etc.
  Configuration properties vary by connector type.

* *Schema Configuration*: Resource schema (attributes) can be defined statically or generated automatically when the connector initializes and if the resource supports getting schema. Most resources support this, e.g., LDAP, Database Table, CSV file, Active Directory.
  The resource schema differs for each connector and/or resource (e.g., two LDAP-based resources can use the same connector but have different attributes).

* *Schema Handling*: Specification of handling objects defined in the resource schema. For example, read-only or read-write attributes, account object classes, expressions to determine values, etc.
  Schema handling specifies how an IDM administrator should use the resource schema, e.g., what object types to use for accounts, attribute setup, password management, etc.
  It is where resource behavior customization occurs and influences how the resource will be presented in the GUI.

* *Resource Capabilities*: Resource capabilities can configure special features of the resource. If this section is used, it overrides connector's capabilities. This configuration can simulate capabilities if the connector does not support them or hide native connector capabilities for a specific resource.
  For example, account de/activation: which attribute stores the account status and what values represent activated/deactivated accounts.

* *TODO Scripts (Before/After Actions)*: Scripts can run custom actions before/after connector operations. For instance, creating a home directory for users and setting access rights.
  Not all connectors support scripts; language and script arguments are specific to each connector.

* *Synchronization*: Synchronization enables you to sync changes from the resource to midPoint. Changes like account creation, modification, and deletion can be synchronized if the resource and connector support it or by using other synchronization methods.

== XML Namespaces

Several XML namespaces are used within the resource object. Refer to the chapter xref:/midpoint/devel/xml-namespace-list/[XML Namespace List] for details.
In examples, we use these prefixes:

* *icfc*: Connector schema namespace (attributes common for all ICF connectors)
* *icfs*: Resource schema namespace (attributes common for all ICF connectors)
* *icfcconnector*: Connector schema for each connector type (attributes only for this connector type)
* *ri*: Resource instance (attributes only for this resource instance)
* *c*: MidPoint's common schema (attributes common for all midPoint objects)

For more details and example code, refer to the _Resource Configuration_ chapter xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/[Resource Configuration].

To use the resource samples documented in the xref:/connectors/[Resource and Connector Reference] chapter:
* Each resource sample is documented inline.
  Follow the inline documentation for guidance.
