<h2>Project Start</h2>

<p>
    MidPoint project started in April 2011 by several key people that were working on the OpenIDM project.
    Initial midPoint release was based on the unreleased version 1.7 of OpenIDM.
    There were several reasons for splitting up with OpenIDM:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The publicly visible development effort of OpenIDM by the ForgeRock team efficiently ceased in February 2011. ForgeRock haven't publicly announced any updated plan for OpenIDM.</li>
    <li>The part of the team that was led by nLight had done most of the design and development work to date. That part of the team had a differing view on further development of OpenIDM than the ForgeRock team had. ForgeRock decided to take a development path different from the one that was originally envisioned for OpenIDM.</li>
    <li>The "nLight part" of the team was confident that the original design needed just few adjustments and most of these adjustments were expected and accounted for in the design. Therefore it was decided that the existing OpenIDM code should not be wasted and the development should continue in the original spirit.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The people from nLight and few other companies joined forces and established a new company: Evolveum.
    The Evolveum mission is to lead a pragmatic development of professional open-source projects.
    Short-term goal is to carry on the development of OpenIDM following the original approach. Product name was changed to midPoint. The members of Evolveum team are original authors of significant part of the code base, therefore it was decided to start a completely new project using the code that the Evolveum team "owns" and, in an open-source spirit, reuse some of the other parts of the OpenIDM code base.
</p>
<p>
    ForgeRock announced plans for further OpenIDM development in June 2011.
    It was obvious that the two development branches are following very different approach:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The OpenIDM v2 development led by ForgeRock took an approach of a total rewrite of the complete system. OpenIDMv2 is based on popular but unproven and immature technologies.</li>
    <li>The midPoint development led by Evolveum took an approach of gradual improvement. MidPoint is based on stable, proven and well understood technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    First ten midPoint releases were named after Titans from the greek mythology.
    It begins with Prometheus who brought fire to the men and continues with other Titans.
    This naming convention describes the overall motive of the era very well.
    There midPoint releases provided features that a traditional user provisioning system should have.
    The goal was to build a solid foundation and feature base.
    The goal was to bring a new project to the state where it can technologically match the competition.
</p>
<p>
    There was always innovation in midPoint, even in this era.
    But it was mostly hidden inside.
    MidPoint versions from the era of the Titans feels and looks like an traditional identity management system.
