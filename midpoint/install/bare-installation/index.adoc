:page-nav-title: Bare Installation

Bare installation is the situation when the target is directly the system - HW.
It is sometime used as synonym for "old way" or "old approach".

The particular information is still valid, but it is not necessary to know as it is already prepared (hidden) in containers.
This part of the documentation is focused mainly for developers or people who want / need to have deeper knowledge about installation.
For the most of the common situation this information is optional.
