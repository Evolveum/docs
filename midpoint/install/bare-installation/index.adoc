:page-nav-title: Bare Installation

Bare installation section is focused on traditional installation.
The particular information is still valid, but it is not necessary to know until you are working with the containers - these steps are already prepared for you in container configuration.

This part of the documentation is focused mainly for developers or people who want / need to have deeper knowledge about installation.
For the most of the common situation this information is optional.
