This page describes midPoint installation in Docker and includes Docker Compose samples.
You can use the Docker environment provided by midPoint out-of-box, however, small syntax updates may be required.

For broader context, see :

* Common xref:../[containers] related information with options to customize the installation. +

* xref:../kubernetes.adoc[Kubernetes] related information with a sample configuration. +

* Container xref:../customization.adoc[customization] related information. +

== Preparing the Environment
// this entire page is missing a top level description of individual steps
To have a working midPoint environment, more than just one application is needed.
To address this complexity, we prepared a description file which can be easily processed - a Docker Compose file.
This file contains a definition for all parts and also provides the necessary settings.
You can "run" the file and thus create an isolated working environment.

=== Docker Engine
To install midPoint, you will need Docker Compose which requires a Docker environment.
The environment must include the *Docker Engine*.

[NOTE]
====
See Docker documentation related to installation based on your OS:

* link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Linux - Docker Engine] +
The Docker Engine can be installed directly.

* link:https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/[Windows - Docker Desktop] +
For Windows, the Docker Engine is only available as a part of the Docker Desktop application.
Any configuration of the Docker Desktop installation is suitable for the purposes of this guide.
Feel free to use the default settings during the installation process.
====


=== Docker Compose Definition
Download the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evolveum/midpoint-docker/master/docker-compose.yml[Docker Compose file from Github].
In your terminal, you can download it by running the following `curl` command:

[source,bash]
----
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evolveum/midpoint-docker/master/docker-compose.yml
----

It is recommended not to rename the downloaded *docker-compose.yml* file.
If you use a different name, you need to define it explicitly in all Docker Compose commands with the *-f* parameter. +

[NOTE]
====
All objects based on the Docker Compose file will contain the directory name as a prefix.
====

=== Database Password Initialization (Optional)
You can find a "static" password for the database in the Docker Compose definition file, *db.secret.pw.007*.
This configuration is less secure, but the focus is on deploying quickly in this case.

If you want to manage passwords more securely, refer to link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/use-secrets/[Secrets in Compose].

[WARNING]
====
To use secrets in Docker Compose, you need to append the *_FILE* suffix to all environment variables that store passwords.

Namely, rename: +

* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to `POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE` +
* `MP_SET_midpoint_repository_jdbcPassword` to `MP_SET_midpoint_repository_jdbcPassword_FILE` (two occurrences) +

This is because the value of each variable will be the path to a file containing the secret instead of the secret itself as a plain string.
Any image used in the provided Docker Compose file can work with this suffix.
====

== Managing the Environment

Start the environment in the background:
[source,bash]
----
docker compose up -d
----

The web GUI becomes available once the environment starts and the initiation (loading initial objects into the empty repository, etc.) is completed.
This may take some time.

If you want to stop the container, use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose down
----

This command stops the container but keeps it defined.
The data stays available for the next run.

To stop and reset the environment (clean up the data), you can use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose down -v
----

[WARNING]
====
Using the *-v* parameter also removes the volumes.
Volumes are the spaces where data is stored outside of containers, i.e. a persistent storage that holds data so that it can be re-used after removing or re-creating containers.

In other words, if you use the *-v* parameter, user data related to the container will also be removed, for example the DB (repository) content.
====

The following table shows the most common commands:

.A summary of the available Docker Compose commands.
[%autowidth]
|====
| Command | Result

| `docker compose up -d`
| Starts the environment based on the Docker Compose file content.

| `docker compose down`
| Stops the environment (the stored data is kept).

| `docker compose down -v`
| Stops the environment and cleans up the relevant data.

| `docker ps -a`
| Lists all containers currently used in the system.

|====

[NOTE]
====
If you have installed Docker Desktop, you can also start/stop the environment in GUI.

The services from the Docker Compose file are grouped.
The name of the group is the name of the directory where the Docker Compose file is located.

After running the first `docker compose up` command, the environment is shown in the list of available environments.
You can start/stop/remove the environment using the buttons for the respective environment.

== MidPoint User Interface

MidPoint has a web administration user interface.
This is the primary user interface for using and configuring midPoint.
By default, the user interface is accessible at port `8080`:

`http://localhost:8080/midpoint/`

=== Logging In

Log in to user interface as the `administrator` user:

* In *version 4.8.1 and newer*, there is no default password for security reasons.
With the first run, an administrator user is initiated and a new password is generated.
This is then saved in a log file.
See xref:/midpoint/reference/security/authentication/administrator-initial-password/[Administrator Initial Password] for details.

* In *version 4.8 and lower*, the default credentials are as follows:

+
[%autowidth, cols="h,1"]
|====
| Username | `administrator`
| Password | `5ecr3t`
|====


=== Take a Look Around

The administrator is an all-powerful user. Therefore, all capabilities of midPoint are at your disposal.
Feel free to take a look around.

* The *Self Service* part of the interface is used to manage the identity and privileges of the currently logged in user.

* The *Administration* part of the user interface is used to manage user identities, roles, organizational structure, and policies.
This part is used for routine administration of the system.
At this stage, this is perhaps the most interesting part of midPoint to explore.

* The *Configuration* part of the user interface is used to customize midPoint behavior, going deep into the midPoint internals.

=== Terminology

MidPoint uses terminology that is common in the identity management field.
However, it may be slightly confusing for people coming from other fields.
The following list explains some of the elementary midPoint terms:

* *User* means a user record (profile) in the midPoint database.
This data record usually contains unified data synchronized with source systems.

* *Resource* is a remote system that is connected to midPoint.
It can be a source system that feeds data to midPoint, or a target system managed by midPoint.

* *Account* is a data structure (user profile) that resides on _resource_ (source or target system).
MidPoint reads data from accounts or manages them.

* *Role* gives privileges to users.
It may also specify what _accounts_ a _user_ should have on what _resources_ .

== Next Steps

A standalone MidPoint will not do much.
You need to connect midPoint to a source or target system (a _resource_).
However, midPoint is a very powerful and comprehensive system.
There are many things that can be set up, customized, and adjusted when a new _resource_ is connected to midPoint.

=== Something Went Wrong ...

Q: Something went wrong. I have no idea what is going on.

A: The best way to start midPoint diagnostics is to look into the midPoint logs.

The logs are visible in the console through the standard Docker logging mechanism: `docker logs midpoint_server`.

=== My First Resource Won't Work

Q: My first resource won't work. There are connection errors. I can see no data. Nothing works.

A: Examine the error message.
You can expand the error message to get more details.
Keep in mind that connecting a new system to midPoint may be tricky.
There are nice systems that use standard protocols and provide good error messages.
However, many systems are not very nice.
They deviate from standards, require exotic configurations, and return cryptic error messages.
If the resource does not work on the first try, it is usually helpful to <<resources,learn more>> about midPoint and its workings.
