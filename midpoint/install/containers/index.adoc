== Quick Start

The containers are the easiest and the fastest way how to start working with midPoint.
In case this is your the fist contact with midPoint please see the xref:../../quickstart[Quick Start] page which contain basic information useful in case of the first contact.

//TODO sync with quick start page...

== Benefits of midPoint in container

* Dependency under full control +
The container is created with the required Java version.

* Cloud friendly +
The container can be run both locally (e.g. docker, podman) or even in the cloud (e.g. kubernetes, aws, Azure, Google cloud).

* The starting state is guaranteed +
Anytime you can easily start new environment in many scenarios in fully controlled way.

* Pre-configured environment +
Basic configuration is available.
The environment is almost ready to run - only small specific setting is needed.
There is available all requirements to initialize the repository. +
The image can be easily xref:./customization.adoc[Customized] by the configuration to cover the most of the expected usage.

[WARNING]
====
Image is based on standards from OCI (Open Container Initiative).
The documentation is focused on Docker or vanilla Kubernetes usage. +
You can use any other compatible environment.
In that case te following content is still valid for you.
Small customization of the configuration for the specific environment may be needed.
====

== Deployment

For the regular operation the repository (relation DB) is needed.
There is required native repository schema which is available for postgreSQL.
As far as we are in container environment, this is covered by additional container with PostgreSQL instance.

The structure (schema) have to be initiated in advance.
Once the correct schema version is ready, the midPoint is checking the initial object (content) and push it if necessary.

[NOTE]
====
There is available generic repository implementation which cover also other than PostgreSQL DB.
This repository schema is deprecated.
The available feature set is limited and no new features are available with these repository schema.
In case you are historically using this repository schema we strongly recommend to migrate to native repository.

The availability of deprecated generic repository schema may require the active subscription.

.Schema of the containerized environment (base setup)
image::containerized_env.png[]

In basic setup there are 3 containers needed.

* *Repository* - *midpoint_data* in the diagram +
For the repository we need only _running_ instance of PostgreSQL server where is possible to connect from the midPoint container.
All the rest is handled from client side of the connection
+
Image : postgres +
Tag : see xref:/midpoint/release/{{ lastReleased.version }}/#databases[release] notes for recommended version (e.g. 16-alpine)

* Initialization of the environment - *data_init* in the diagram +
This container handle all the requirements for the environment which have to be prepared before the midPoint instance will start.
+
The requirement is to use the same version of the image as for container with midPoint to be sure the correct version of definition is used.

** Repository init +
The process use ninja application to connect to the database as a client.
If needed the repository structure (schema) is created. +
In the diagram this communication is shown as _Network data_.

** Configuration init +
The process use ninja application to get ready base native repository configuration.
All additional information like DB URI is updated afterward via environment variable(s) on the container.+
In the diagram this communication is shown as _Storage data_.
+
[NOTE]
====
In the complex installation the init phase can be skipped by the design.
In that case the environment is initialized separately as explicit process during the build of the environment. +
The provided configuration count with the situation that the environment is prepared directly during the first run.
====

* midPoint instance - *midpoint_server* in the diagram +
Once the environment is ready the midPoint itself can be started.
+
Image : evolveum/midpoint +
Tag : <released version> (e.g. {{ lastReleased.version }}-alpine )

== Build the container

We are building the images in our link:https://jenkins.evolveum.com/view/midPoint-docker/[jenkins] infrastructure.
After basic tests (e.g. the environment can be started) the images are pushed to the public link:https://hub.docker.com/r/evolveum/midpoint[Docker hub] repository.
All the necessary resources for the docker image build are publicly available like other our resources on link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-docker[GitHub].

=== Structure of the image name

The name consist of the image name and the tag.
The name is "stable" in form *evolveum/midpoint*.
The tag differs the version and base OS used for the image.

Currently we are using the following Base OSs

.Used based OSs for the image and their tag suffixes
|===
| BaseOS| suffix for the tag

| Alpine
| -alpine

| Rocky Linux
| -rockylinux

| Ubuntu
|
|===

[NOTE]
====
Currently the Ubuntu based image is default - without suffix.
We are planning the swith to the apline as the default base OS.
====

.example of the tags
|====
| Version | Base Os | image

| 4.8 release
| Ubuntu
| evolveum/midpoint:4.8

| 4.8 release
| Rocky Linux
| evolveum/midpoint:4.8-rockylinux

| 4.8-support (snapshot)*
| Alpine
| evolveum/midpoint:4.8-support-alpine

| latest dev build
| Alpine
| evolveum/midpoint:latest-alpine

| latest dev build

[NOTE]
====
*Support* branch / support build is build of the working code.
It is used to cumulate the bug fixes between the releases.
If you are looking for some fix (e.g. the ticket is closed with code update ) the support build contain the fix with the first following build.
It is rolling tag so in the time it is changing.
Check for update of the image time to time.
