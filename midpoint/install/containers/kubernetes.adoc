== Deployment

=== Basic deployment

[#basicDepl]
.Basic deployment in kubernetes
image::kubernetes-diagram.png[]

To start the environment, we need several objects.
We can group them by the type / purpose:

* StatefulSet +
Control objects, which provide template for the pods including the scale - amount of requested instance.

* Service +
"Meeting point" for the use case - internal transparent proxy for communication.
As pods has dynamic IPs the IP addresses are assigned after pod creation.
The name of service is known in advance.
It can be used for the connection (e.g. midPoint contacts the repository using service definition).

* Ingress +
Entry point for the user.
It is reverse proxy - first point of contact for the communication from outside on shared ports (http - TCP/80, https - TCP/443).
Once the definition matches, the communication is passed to the defined service.

* _Pod_ +
The pods is not defined directly in this deployment.
It is a result of the statefulSet definition.
+
Technically, it is the place where the application is running.
The other objects are about to create the pod with proper configuration and make it reachable.

=== Simple deployment with PVC and secret

[#simpleDepl]
.Simple deployment with PVC and secret in kubernetes
image::kubernetes-diagram-pvc_secret.png[]

This diagram extends the Basic one with two objects.

* Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) +
To keep data persistent over the container re-creation we need external storage space.
In this scenario, the PVC is created based on the template located in statefulset.
In case of scaling each pod will have its own PVC.

* Secret +
Object for keeping sensitive information for the use with the Pod(s).
It targets the situation of shared password (e.g. to access the DB we need to "share" the credentials between the DB server and the client connecting into it).

=== Complex deployment

[#complexDepl]
.Complex deployment
image::kubernetes-diagram-complex.png[]

This diagram extends the Simple one with following objects:

* Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) +
To keep data persistent over the container re-creation we need external storage space.
In this scenario the PVC is created based on the PVC definition.
In case of scaling all the pods will share the same PVC.

* ConfigMap +
The object which can keep the content used as environment variable or it can be mounted to the pod's filesystem.

== Working with deployment

=== Prepared object definition

We have prepared the definition for you.
It is located in our link:https://github.com/evolveum/midpoint-kubernetes[github] repository (link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-kubernetes/archive/refs/heads/main.zip[download ZIP]).

For the next steps you need to have the content available locally.
One of the option is to use the link pointing to the ZIP file and unzip it.

[NOTE]
====
The commands mentioned here suppose to be run in the terminal / command line.

`kubectl` is used to communicate with kubernetes cluster.
It is supposed you have working setting allowing you to connect, authenticate and communicate with the kubernetes cluster.

To test you can try to request list of nodes in the cluster : `kubectl get nodes`.

In case you face any issue with kubectl, please refer to kubernetes documentation how to make it work.
====

[#ingressNote]
.Ingress related notes

All the objects except *ingress* definition can be used as they are.

Location of the *ingress* definition is `./deployment/common_a/301_ingress.yaml`.

In regards to Ingress definition few topics, *before applying the files*, should be addressed.

* *ingressClassName* +
In the definition the presence of *nginx* is expected.
In case you have nginx ingress in the kubernetes environment available you are ok with the value prepared in the file.
If not, this option has to be updated to correspond with your kubernetes environment setting.

* tls +
The default certificate for https will be used.
In case you want to use different one, it should be explicitly set in the ingress definition.

[#ingressHost]
* host +
The host *midpoint.example.com* is set in the definition file.
To make it work you should make this value resolvable - to be able to get IP address.
Here are some options how to reach it ( any of them should be sufficient ) :

** change the value (FQDN) to something else what is under your control

** set the record to */etc/hosts* file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts in case of windows)

** set the static record on your local DNS resolver

The environment will be available with following information:

[#accessInfo]
.Access information
[%noheader%autowidth]
|====
|URL:| https://midpoint.example.com ^(1)^

|Username: | administrator

|Initial password: | Test5ecr3t ^(2)^

|====

. on the kubernetes site the FQDN is set using <<#ingressHost,ingress>> object

. The init password is generated by default. In the statefulset definition for midpoint it is forced to be this value. +
MP_SET_midpoint_administrator_initialPassword=Test5ecr3t

[#basicDeplH]
=== Basic deployment handling

For the <<#basicDepl>> the the path `./deployment/basic` is important.

[WARNING]
====
The basic environment store all data in dynamic (non-persistent) store.
In case of pod removing all the related data is deleted.

Please note that it is not possible to partially restart the environment in this scenario.
In case you restart DB your repository is lost.
In case you restart midPoint the key to access encrypted data in repository is lost.

This configuration is good for quick testing, demo, etc.
====

Before applying the configuration files, please check <<#ingressNote>> to correspond with your environment.

.Apply the configuration to create the midpoint environment

namespace "midpoint-deployment" deleted
====

The objects are prepared to use their own namespace - logical group of the objects.
In the provided files it is creating and using the namespace called *midpoint-deployment*.

Once the environment is created it takes several seconds to get it up and running.
First run can take longer as the image has to be downloaded from public registry - docker hub.

For the information how to access the environment please see <<#accessInfo>>

[#simpleDeplH]
=== Simple deployment with PVC and secret handling

This deployment extend <<#basicDeplH>> information.

For the <<#simpleDepl>> the the path `./deployment/simple` is important.

[WARNING]
====
The *repository data* and *midpoint home data* are stored on Persistent Volume Claim.
It is kept even in case the Pod is removed - it is not removed with the *statefulset* definition.

On the other side in case of test(s) the data in the environment from the previous run(s) may be present.

Please note that even it is dedicated object(s) it is still part of namespace.
In case we are removing namespace all member objects are removed even it is not directly addressed.
This statement also covers PVC in the namespace.
====

Before applying the configuration files please check <<#ingressNote>> to correspond with your environment.

No PVC is explicitly defined.
The definition is "hidden" in the statefulset where the section *volumeClaimTemplates* is.
If you prefer to use different size of volume you can change the definition in relevant statefulset before applying the files.

.Volume sizing in the provided yaml definitions
[%autowidth]
|====
| Pod's name | Volume size

| midPoint
| 128 MB

| repository
| 5 GB
|====

The PVC is created based on the template value with the first run.
In case the PVC already exists it is directly used (e.g. re-create the pod).

.Apply the configuration to create the midpoint environment
[source,bash]

Once you want to remove the objects from the kubernetes environment you can decide if custom data (repository data and midPoint home directory) should also be removed.
With the following command you can remove the defined objects keeping namespace and PVC (custom data) for future use.

.Delete the objects related to the midpoint environment (keeping PVC)
[source,bash]

====

If you want to completely remove all related data to the midPoint environment it is possible to simply delete the namespace.
All the related objects are members of namespace.
This also includes indirectly created PVC (we just define template in statefulset and not directly the PVC).

Once the namespace is requested to be deleted, all related objects are removed in cascade.

.Delete all the objects related to the midpoint environment (including namespace and PVC)
[source,bash]

[#complexDeplH]
=== Complex deployment handling

This deployment extend <<#simpleDeplH>> information.

For the <<#complexDepl>> the the path `./deployment/complex` is important.

Before applying the configuration files please check <<#ingressNote>> to correspond with your environment.

All the prepared objects will be member of the namespace - logical group of objects.
We have to create it before any other objects, otherwise an error related to the unknown namespace.
The definition is available in common directory.

The definition of the persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is also available.
You can find it in common directory.

.Create the namespace and PVC for the midPoint environment

----
kubectl apply -f ./deployment/common

====

There is no default administrator password.
We can set the init password by the environment variable.
The definition is prepared to use secret object *midPoint-init-pass* with the key *passwd*.
The object should be created before the midPoint pod will be started.
To create the object run the following command - the password can be changed before the command is executed.

.Create secret object with the initial midPoint password
[source,bash]
----
kubectl create -n midpoint-deployment secret generic midpoint-init-pass --from-literal=passwd=Test5ecr3t

kubectl create configmap -n midpoint-deployment post-initial-objects --from-file=deployment/post-initial-objects/
----

.output from the *create* command
[%collapsible]
====
configmap/post-initial-objects created

[NOTE]
====
The size of object is limited.
In case the limit is reached, one of the solutions is to combine more of them.

.Usage of single configMap:
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: midpoint-pio
      configMap:
        name: post-initial-objects
----

.Combining more objects:
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: midpoint-poi
      projected:
        sources:
          - configMap:
              name: post-initial-objects-1
          - configMap:
              name: post-initial-objects-2
----

====

At this point we are ready to apply the rest of the files.

.Apply the rest of the environment

====

To shutdown the environment you have 2 options.

* scale the replicas to 0 +
Scaling down keeps all the definition in place.
The statefulset as control object is instructed to create 0 replicas - shutdown all running pods.
+
This way we can e.g. selectively shutdown midPoint instances but keeping repository up for maintenance.
+
.Scale midPoint instances to 0 replica
[source,bash]
----
kubectl scale -n midpoint-deployment --replicas=0 sts/midpoint
----
+
.Scale midPoint instances to 1 replica
[source,bash]
----
kubectl scale -n midpoint-deployment --replicas=1 sts/midpoint
----
+
.output from the *scale* command
[%collapsible]
====
statefulset.apps/midpoint scaled
====
+
[NOTE]
====
If there is more than one replica, you will need to configure midPoint in cluster configuration.
The provided configuration is midPoint cluster ready.
The relevant settings are related to :

* taskManager +
The task manager has to get information that there can also be other active nodes.

* intra-cluster URL +
Node ID value source has to be set.

The dedicated doc page is available - xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/clustering-ha/[Clustering / high availability setup].

*Please note that cluster setup in production deployment require the active subscription.*
====

* remove the object definition from kubernetes

In order to remove all objects except Persistent volume claims (PVC) and manually created objects (initial password /secret/ and post-initial-objects /configMap/) you can use available definition to select the objects to be removed.

.Partially delete the midPoint environment
[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete -f ./deployment/complex
----
.output from the *delete* command
[%collapsible]
====
secret "midpoint-repository" deleted +
service "midpoint-repository" deleted +
service "midpoint" deleted +
ingress.networking.k8s.io "midpoint" deleted +
statefulset.apps "midpoint-repository" deleted +
statefulset.apps "midpoint" deleted
====

To remove all the objects including user data (volumes, secret with init password and configMap with Post-initial-objects) the whole namespace can be removed.
The kubernetes will afterwards remove all the objects located in the namespace.

.Delete the namespace with the midPoint environment - cascade clean up
