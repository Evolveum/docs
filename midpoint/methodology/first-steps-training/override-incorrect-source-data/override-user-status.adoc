:page-description: Override the source system user status to force-disable the user's AD account

The first task in the series of overriding source data is to force-disable a user's account regardless of the user's status in the source HR system.
The goal is to prevent the user from accessing target systems—in the case of this guide, Active Directory.

== What awaits you in this module

. Pick an active user, i.e., a user whose `status` in the HRIS equals to `In`.
. Find the user in midPoint and set the user's *administrative status* to _Disabled_.
. Verify the effect of you action on the user's AD account.

== About administrative status

The xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/activation/#administrative-status[administrative status] defines an explicit decision of midPoint administrator about the status of a user.
As such, it overrides all other constraints on activation, including the lifecycle state we use in this guide to determine who is eligible to an AD account.
For this reason, the administrative status is the go to property for disabling a user under an emergency situation because it does not get overwritten by any mapping like the xref:/midpoint/methodology/first-steps/connect-source-system/define-mapping-and-synchronization-rules/#map-user-data[lifecycle state would] in our case.

.Effective status vs. administrative status
[TIP]
====
xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/activation/#effective-status[ Effective status ] is a virtual status, a computed combination of all constraints on an object activation.
It cannot be set directly, it depends on the `validFrom` and `validTo` attributes, the lifecycle state, or administrative status.
If any of the constraints affecting the effective status says the account should be disabled, the effective status changes to _Disabled_.
That is what you see in the GUI at top of the user profile.
The administrative status is, under normal circumstances, _Undefined_, meaning it does not affect the effective status anyhow.

== Set administrative status for a user

For this exercise, let us say that the contract termination specialist Ashley Jackson is the user you need to disarm immediately.

. In [.nowrap]#icon:user[] *Users*# > [.nowrap]#icon:user[] *Persons*#, open _Ashley Jackson_ (user _ajackson_) for editing.
. Select [.nowrap]#icon:recycle[] *Activation*# on the left.
. Click *Show empty fields* if you do not see any fields to edit.
. In *Administrative status*, select _Disabled_.
. Click [.nowrap]#icon:save[] btn:[Save]#.

.Set administrative status for Ashley Jackson

The effect of this action is immediate.
Changing the administrative status of a user triggers update according to the policies and rules you have set all across the ecosystem, meaning the update propagates to the AD server without having to wait for the next scheduled reconciliation.

== Verify the effect of administrative status change

To confirm the effect of you setting the administrative status, select [.nowrap]#icon:magnifying-glass-chart[] *Audit Log Viewer*# to head over to the audit log, and see the three related events there (request, resource, execution).

.Changing the administrative status to Disabled triggers disabling the user in the target AD application
image::midpoint-audit-log-administrative-status-change-triggers-ldap-attribute-provisioning.webp["Audit log screen with events showing the effects of changing the administrative status to Disabled which triggers disabling the user in the target AD application"]

Click the time stamp on the *Resource* entry in the audit log to see the exact change your action caused:

.The mapping rules in effect translate effective status _Disabled_ to the `roomNumber` resource attribute value `disabled`
image::midpoint-audit-log-administrative-status-change-triggers-ldap-attribute-provisioning-detail.webp["Audit log screen showing the effects of the administrative status change - the mapping rules in effect translate effective status Disabled to the roomNumber resource attribute Disabled"]

You can check directly on the AD resource that your change of the administrative status provisioned Ashley Jackson the `disabled` value into the `roomNumber` attribute, effectively barring her from accessing Active Directory.

.The attribute `roomNumber` with the value `disabled` has been provisioned to the AD account of the user disabled by the administrative status
image::ldap-account-disabled-attribute-roomnumber.webp["Attribute roomNumber with the value disabled has been provisioned to the account of the user disabled by the administrative status"]

== How to revert the changes made by administrative status

Should you need to enable the user and take all the disabling action back, change the *Administrative status* attribute back to _Undefined_.
The effective status then gets calculated based on all the "usual" policies and rules, and re-enables the user's account if nothing else says it should not be enabled.

== Next steps

In the next module, you will learn how to manage the situation when the information in the HRIS is wrong and you need to address the issue before the HR personnel can handle it the standard way.
