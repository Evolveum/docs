= Methodology: First Steps With MidPoint
:page-toc: top

WARNING: Work in progress

== Introduction

This is a description of simplified midPoint deployment methodology, guiding quick deployment of simple midPoint configurations.

This document is a guide to identity management deployment for small to mid-size organizations.
It describes an _iterative_ approach, providing value in small steps.

TODO: few more lines introducing the process, set expectations.

== Audience

This guide is targeted at an organization that fits following description:

* Managing hundreds to thousands of identities.

* Existing identity processes are mostly manual, possibly with some simple (homebrewed) automation (e.g. scripts or ancient identity management systems).

* There is no dedicated identity management team.
Identity management tasks are executed by general IT staff, as part of their day-to-day responsibilities.
However, there is some basic understanding of identity management concepts in IT team.

* No strict regulation compliance requirements.
Alternatively, there may be compliance requirements, yet addressing them is not immediate priority.

* There is a motivation to improve identity management, with some support from the management and reasonable budget.

* Typical organizations: mid-size enterprise, smaller government or academic institution, municipality

IT environment of the organization:

* There is a feasible source of identity data, such as human resources (HR) system.
This source has authoritative data on most of the identities.
(There is no requirement for the data to be complete or 100% exact).
There is a simple way to get the data out of the system, such as structured text export (CSV), or a database view.

* There is one "main" system that need to be managed, such as Active Directory.
Automatic management of identities in this system will provide significant benefits for the organization.
Also, there may be several such systems in the organization.

* There are some operational procedures and conventions in place, such as a convention to systematically generate a username and e-mail address.
However, there are likely exceptions, e.g. e-mail address of top management, usernames generated before the convention was in place and so on.

Which means that:

* Quality of identity data is probably low.
The HR system was maintained manually, without any automated validation of the data.
There will be typos, outdated and incomplete data.
The accounts in Active Directory (or equivalent system) were managed manually, without any regular and automated checks.
There will be accounts that belonged to employees that left several years ago.
There will be accounts still using maiden names of women that got married years ago.
There will be non-conventional usernames and account names.

* There are limited human resources that can be dedicated for identity management.
The implementation must proceed in parallel to the usual IT operation routines, requiring only a reasonable amount of effort.

* The management will want to see tangible results quite soon.
Identity management deployment cannot be executed in a "big bang" way, spending years on analysis and implementation.

* The ideal plan would be to proceed in iterations, providing value in small steps.
Each step taking several months, at most.


.No free lunch
TIP: We live in a material world.
Money are needed to do almost anything.
Identity management is no exception.
Even though midPoint is an open source _platform_ and there are no licence costs or any other costs directly associated with use of midPoint, the identity management _deployment_ is not free.
You will need money to pay your staff, pay for trainings, assistance and support.
Reasonably-sized budget is needed to get tangible results.

== Big Picture

TODO: intro, iterations, etc.

We propose to proceed in following steps:

. *Kick-off*: Start the project.
Set goals.
Identify crucial data sources and targets.
Make a plan.
Secure budget.

. *Assessment*: Set up midPoint.
Load data from the source.
Compare the data with the target.
Assess data quality.
Decide next steps.

. *Automation*: Automate management of identities (to a reasonable degree).
Speed up on-boarding processes.
Make off-boarding process more reliable, improving security.
Keep data up to date.

These three steps start up a *program*, a never-ending process to maintain and expand the solution.
The progress of the program may be as fast or as slow as you need.
It is an endless iteration of several on-demand activities, executed as needed:

* Connect new systems.
Add more systems to your solution, much like you did in the _assessment_ step before.
This is increasing _breadth_ (scope) of your solution.

* Increase automation.
Add automated data mappings, processes and basic policies.
Your processes will run faster, more reliably, with less manual steps.
This is increasing _depth_ of your solution.

* Clean up the data.
Your data were created and maintained manually.
They often do really match exactly between systems, the data are often out of date, there are inaccuracies and errors.
Manual processes can often tolerate quite a high degree of data disorganization.
However, increased automation heavily relies on accurate data.
There is a constant need to monitor and improved data quality, correct errors, resolve inaccuracies and inconsistencies.
This is increasing _quality_ of your solution.

Apart from the three main steps, there are many optional iterations to add new systems, clean up data and increase automation.
The iterations can be repeated as many times as needed, with as big or as small scope as needed.
The overall goal of the program is to bring convergence: convergence of the data, processes and policies.

image::first-steps-big-picture.png[Process big picture]

There is no pre-determined number of iterations.
The iterations should be executed as long as they bring sufficient value.
However, as the business and IT environment is ever-changing, it is very likely that at least some part of the program will become part of ordinary operational routine.

Once the first steps are complete, data are reasonably reliable, important systems are covered and processes are automated to appropriate degree, it is time to move to the next steps.
The next logical step is to focus on identity _governance_, managing entitlements, identity-related policies and business processes.

== Initial Steps

TODO: following sections provide detailed description of the steps.

TODO: Each step has a specific goal. The goal is summarized at the end of step description.

=== Step 1: Kick-Off

You have to start somewhere.
At this point, you probably have a very rough idea what you want to achieve.
However, all the details are missing.
The goal of this step is to fill some details in, make a plan, set up project structure and secure necessary resources.

Start with a brainstorming or "kick-off" meeting.
Gather all the people in your organization interested in identity management.
This does not have to be a formal team.
The project is not formally established anyway.
Gather all the people that have something to say.

You will probably need to engage following persons:

* Senior IT engineer or an architect.
Identity management is touching many things, you want someone with broad perspective and IT experience.

* Active Directory administrator, or an administrator of a critical IT systems that you want to manage.

* Someone from HR, or any person that is somehow familiar with HR practices.
HR is going to be your information source, you need someone that can help you assess impact of HR practices on your project.

* Security professional.
Identity management is intimately related to information security.
There may be policies, constraints and goals given by company security policy, which you should definitely consider in your plans.

In fact, especially in smaller organizations, this can a "meeting" of just a couple of people over the cup of coffee.
This can be a series of meetings.
Do whatever suits your organizational culture the best.

The results of the initial meeting/kickoff/brainstorming should be:

* Identify *data source*, which will probably be HR system.
Discuss the data the HR has, their scope and quality.
Do they have data on all employees?
Do they have also a data on contractors?
How are the data updated and maintained.
E.g. how are records of new employees enrolled?
How are data of former employees handled?
Are the records deleted, marked as inactive, set a lay-off date or something else?
+
You will probably get CSV export of HR data, or perhaps a database table/view.
Both are perfectly fine, at least for now.
Request a sample data from the HR people, to make sure data formats will work for you.

* Identify *data target*, which will probably be Active Directory (AD).
Discuss the structure of AD users with the administrator.
Are all the users in a single organizational unit in the AD?
Are there several organizational units.
How is the AD username created?
Are there any conventions to generate username?
Are there exceptions to these conventions.
Is there a reliable identifier stored somewhere in the user account?
Maybe an employee number is conveniently stored in `employeeNumber` attribute?
Have a look at live AD data, selecting few examples (such as your own account), roughly assessing the situation.
Compare that with the HR data sample.
+
Discuss the practices of creating an AD account.
Are there any special procedures or manual steps that take place?
How is the initial password set, how it is delivered to the user?
Is there a need to create a home directory, file share, mailbox?
What is the procedure to delete/archive account?
Discuss which steps would be nice to automate, and which are best left for manual action.

* Discuss *security*.
Discuss the limitations, requirements and wishes given by the information security policies.
+
Do not overdo it.
This is very important.
Security professionals tend to provide long lists of non-negotiable security requirements that need to be satisfied right now.
Do not get distracted to theoretical discussions of information security.
Discuss the practice, the current state, the day-to-day reality.
Be honest to yourself.
Do not pretend that you have perfect security while the reality is vastly different.
+
Goal of identity management is to _improve real security_, not to pretend that the security is perfect while it is not.
Do not try to satisfy all the security requirements and requests immediately.
Make a plan to address the requirements in iterations.
It is too early to focus solely on security at this point.
Basing security on wrong data is no security anyway, it is just false sense of security.
You need to put your data back in line first, then built up from there.

* Discuss other data targets (optional).
What other systems would you like to connect to your identity management deployment in the future?
Consider just the big picture for now.
You do not need to go to all the details.
Just roughly set the scope, listing and prioritizing the systems.
Although this kind of perspective is completely optional, it is a huge benefit for planning and budgeting.

* Discuss *resources, timing and rough plan*.
Keep you plan realistic.
Identity management requires systematic approach, time and a lot of patience.
Too many projects have failed due to unrealistic plans and expectations.
Plan modest results, delivered in few months.
Then proceed in iterations, delivering improvements every few months.
Prepare for a long run.
This is not a project, with a specific start and end.
This is a _program_.
It starts now, yet it has no end.
Discuss who will lead the program, what people will need to be involved, other resource that you will need.

* Discuss *money*.
You will need money, even if you plan to do most of the work internally.
You will need training, assistance and support.
Plan a recurring budget, sustainable funding for many years to come.
Having a modest budget every year can lead to a successful identity management program.
Having a generous budget for year one and no budget after that is a certain way to an expensive failure.

You do not need to have all the answers to all the questions at this point.
We will get to that later.
What you need is an overview of your situation.
It is perfectly OK to leave a lot of blank spaces in your plan now.
The important thing is to know that you have a lot of black spaces that need to be filled in later.

Maybe you will need some time to get your plan straight.
Take your time.
Learn and explore in the meantime.
Do some read-up on identity management.
Watch videos.
Download midPoint and have some fun.
If you are a hands-on type, create a small prototype.
All of that will help you better understand your problems, and also the tools that you have at hand.
Gather your collaborators again, update your plan as necessary.

Now comes the most important step.
*Talk to your management*.
Make sure that the management understands importance of identity management for your organization.
As identity management touches many parts of the IT infrastructure as well as business processes and organizational procedures, support from your management is critical for success.
You will also need time and money.
Make sure there are human resources and appropriate budget allocated for your project.
Do not exaggerate, do not oversell.
Provide honest plan and estimates, set realistic expectations.
Identity management is a long run, any kind of hype or exaggeration is very likely to backfire in the future.
Get a green light - for a long program, not just for a short project.

Now, you are ready to go.

*Goal*: Assess your resources, capabilities and goals.
Set your target.
Decide whether the project is feasible.
Make a rough plan.
Get long-term support from management.
Secure budget.

=== Step 2: Assessment

You have some kind of HR data now.
In theory, you should use the HR data to create and manage accounts in target system, such as your Active Directory.
However, in practice, this is not entirely straightforward.

Firstly, it is almost certain that there are errors and inaccuracies in the HR data.
The data were maintained manually for a long time, with no way for automatic validation.
Mistakes in the data might be buried deep, surviving undetected for decades.
Having nothing to compare the data with, there is no telling how good or bad the data are.

Secondly, the data in your target systems (especially Active Directory) certainly leave a lot to be desired.
These were managed manually for years, with no automatic way to make sure they are correct.
There will be account belonging to people that left your organizations years ago.
There will be accounts using maiden names of women that are married now.
There will be strange accounts and identifiers that originated ages ago when your organization was still small and system administration was fun.
There may be all kinds of weirdness and historical baggage frozen in time because nobody remembers what it does and everybody is scared to touch it.

Taking HR data and simply forcing them to Active Directory will never work.
We need much smarter approach.

// TODO: bridge to the following text

This is what you have to do:

. *Connect HR* data source to midPoint.
Set up your HR identity resource in midPoint, using CSV or DatabaseTable connector.
Deal with just the very basic data items for now:
* Names (given name, family name)
* Employee number, student number or similar identifier
* Status (active, former employee, alumni, etc.) and/or validity date/time (based on contract etc.)
+
Ignore other fields for now.
We will get back to them later.

. *Import users* to midPoint, using HR data.
Select appropriate algorithm for midPoint username.
You surely have some username convention (such as `jsmith`) in place.
Then import the HR data, creating user objects in midPoint.
As we are working with simple data for now, the import should go well.

. *Connect Active Directory*.
Set up your Active Directory (or perhaps LDAP) identity resource in midPoint.
Set up mappings for the small data set that you have (given name, username and so on).
Set the mappings in _comparison_ (TODO!) mode.
We do not want to change any data yet.

. *Correlate Active Directory accounts* with midPoint users.
If you have employee numbers stored in your Active Directory, then use that for correlation.
If you do not, use generated midPoint usernames (e.g. `jsmith` convention) as the correlation identifier to match (assumed) majority of the accounts to their corresponding owners in midPoint:
.. Run the _reconciliation_ task on AD resource (TODO! Something more user-friendly in the resource rather than creating a task?).
.. Then have a look at the results in midPoint GUI (interactively).

+
If you maintained your identifier assignment conventions reasonably well, most identities should correlate well.
MidPoint will show you correlation statistics for your accounts.
Of course, there will be problems of `John Smith` and `Josh Smith` with their `jsmith` and `jsmith42` accounts.
Let's leave that for later.
For now just focus on correlating the bulk of users.
If you get 80-90% users to correlate well, you are done here.
Activate the correlation action (TODO: turning on `UNLINKED` -> `link` reaction) and correlate the majority of your accounts now.

+
Of course, you are doing this for the first time.
Chances are that you have not got all your configuration exactly right at the first try.
If you need to make configuration adjustments, just make them and re-run the reconciliation task.
In case of deeper problem, it is still OK to scrap your AD resource and do it again (go back to step 3).
Maybe you need to grab more data from HR feed (e.g. you have not mapped employee number to midPoint, did you?).
In that case you still can purge all identity data from midPoint, adjust HR configuration and import everything again (go back to step 2).

. *Clean up the orphaned accounts*:
Review the list of orphaned accounts (accounts in Active Directory not having an owner in midPoint which should mean they are not related to HR data on which midPoint data is based) and identify the following cases:

* *orphaned accounts*: accounts which were not matched to midPoint data during correlation, and should not be in Active Directory. Review these accounts one by one and _mark_ the undesired ones as disposable. *TODO NEW FEATURE REQUIRED*
* *system (service) accounts*: accounts which are not based on HR data, but are crucial for Active Directory. Review these accounts one by one and _mark_ the system accounts as protected in midPoint.
+
The accounts need to be reviewed manually and actions can take place either in the AD (by its administrators), or in midPoint (e.g. by configuring the system accounts as protected).
*TODO now or in Step 3?* You can now activate the orphaned account deactivation (TODO: turning on `marked as disposable` -> `disable` / `delete`) to deactivate/delete all orphaned accounts (marked as disposable) in the target system using midPoint.
+
TIP: You can clean up the data in several iterations.

. *Clean up the accounts with data inconsistencies.*
Review the rest of accounts which have not been matched or decided in the previous steps.
This is the time to take care of the Smiths, Johnsons and Browns.
Have a look at all the `jsmith`, `smithj` and `jsmith2` accounts.
Try to figure out which account belongs to which user and correlate them manually.
If you did the last steps well, there should be just a handful of them.
+
TIP: You can clean up the data in several iterations.

. *Clean up the incorrect mappings* to avoid undesired changes in AD accounts.
Review the accounts where midPoint indicates a change of account attributes.
This means there are differences between the account attribute values in the target system and the values computed by midPoint for these accounts in _comparison_ (TODO!) mode.
Review the mappings.
Chances are that the mappings are working correctly, but data in Active Directory does not correspond to them because it was previously managed manually and can contain errors.
Adapt the mappings in midPoint to not cause undesired changes in Active Directory.
+
TIP: You can clean up the mappings in several iterations.
+
*TODO now or in Step 3?* When you are satisfied with the mappings, (TODO!) change the mappings to actually set the values.
##From that moment, midPoint can update existing accounts in Active Directory.##

This may seem as a pointless phase.
Why not just go directly to automation?
That is what we really want!
However, assessment is all but pointless.
Automation can be done only after the assessment phase is done.
Attempts to automate processes with unreliable data are futile, they invariably lead to failures, usually a very expensive failures.
Speaking from a couple of decades of identity management experience, there is no such thing as reliable data, unless the data are cleaned up and systematically maintained with an assistance of identity management platform.
Simply speaking: you may think that our data is good, but they are not.

TODO

*Goal*: Asses the _real_ data quality, determine practical next steps.
At this point we know what we _really_ have, what we can build on, what needs to be improved.
We can identify the most severe security risks, such as orphaned accounts.
Now we can improve our plan, adding more details based on the _real_ data.



==== Reporting Notes

We need the following types of report:

. *What is in target system and is not in midPoint?* This allows detection of orphaned accounts, system accounts etc. This is more or less a reconciliation report.
. *What is in midPoint but not in target system?* This allows detection of missing rules between midPoint and target system, e.g. missing conditions for automatic provisioning for certain populations etc. This is more or less a simulation report.
. *What will midPoint change in the target system?* This allows detection of incorrect/missing mappings between midPoint and target system as well as between midPoint and source system. This is more or less a simulation report.

For all reports: how to execute actions (manual correlation etc.) from the reports?
Using interactive pages a'la menu:Resource[Accounts]?

TODO: new idea based on M. Spanik's idea: side-by-side report. See <<side-by-side-report,below>>.

===== What is in target system (AD) and is not in midPoint?

Implementation in midPoint: target system reconciliation + reconciliation report.

The report (ideally interactive in Resource/Accounts, exportable to Excel) should contain the following information:

Query:

* just like reconciliation report (working with Shadows of certain resource)

Columns:

* Account identifier (TODO which one in case of AD? `dn` or `userPrincipalName`?)
* Situation
** (with some tooltip/help for administrators about meaning)
** (display also what would happen if this is not dry-run!!! e.g. account would be deleted (situations/reactions)
* *TODO what about identity matching? Some kind of probability...? And reason?*
** *TODO* if situation is `DISPUTED`, we could perhaps indicate potencial owners in the report?
** *TODO* if situation is `DISPUTED`, *Change owner* action should perhaps use the potential owners instead of showing all users in midPoint?
* Intent *TODO may be confusing for beginners!*
* Owner or *Potential owner* (in case we have dry-run) (TODO maybe also indicate why it was matched?)
** Maybe rename `Owner` to `Matched user` or `MidPoint User` or something like that...
* Pending operations *TODO not necessarily needed for this case - read-only reconciliation*

.Example report
|===
|Account identifier TODO which one in AD?|Situation|Owner/Candidate owner

|jsmith@example.com
|UNMATCHED (tooltip: Account in target system without owner in midPoint)
|(none)

|jdoe@example.com
|UNLINKED (tooltip: Account in target system with candidate owner in midPoint)
|John Doe (jdoe)

|jsmith24@example.com
|LINKED (tooltip: Account in target system owned by midPoint user)
|John Smith (jsmith24)

|jsmith48@example.com
|DISPUTED (tooltip: Account cannot be correlated to one midPoint user)
|
John Smith (jsmith2) - 33%

Joe Smith (jsmith7) - 33%

Jack Smith (jsmith98) - 33%

|===


Visualisation notes:

* TODO: Either use *Repository* or *Resource* view, but do not confuse user. If we use passive caching...?
* Search: ability to hide rows based on at least `SITUATION`, `protected` but not only that
* Ability to export the (interactive) view to Excel for further processing outside midPoint
* Top part of report ("summary panel"):
** Show some kind of "pie graph" or something similar to graphically represent the state to see how optimistic/pesimistic the situation is.
** The colors for situations `UNMATCHED`, `DISPUTED` (possibly others) can be emphasized to indicate problems or need for decisions.
** Percentages of `UNMATCHED`, `DISPUTED` (possibly others) can help to distinguish if the problem is caused by *correlation misconfiguration* (many `UNMATCHED`) or *data quality issues* (many `DISPUTED`). Some suggestions based on this may be displayed.
** Display if this is a result of dry-run (? TODO ?)
** Display how was the correlation done (maybe descriptions from correlation settings, identity matching etc.). Human-readable! Maybe Axiom query, but not sure about it...
* Protected accounts part:
** List of accounts that are currently protected. If there are none, maybe we should indicate this too, as we usually need some protected accounts anyway.
* List of accounts part:
** see the notes for *Columns* above

===== What is in midPoint and is not in target system (AD)?

NOTE: This report should be executed after the reconciliation to have information about existing state.

TODO Implementation in midPoint: ? recomputation limited to target system (AD) with simulation mode ? Special mapping mode?

The report (ideally interactive in Resource/Accounts, exportable to Excel) should contain the following information:

Query: ? TODO ? focus oriented

Columns:

* User name
* User Full name (or Given Name and Family Name)
* User status (`activation/effectiveStatus` or something else?)
** This can help to diagnose issue when disabled users would be provisioned to AD
* Target system account that would be created (identifier)

.Example report
|===
|User name|Full name|User status|Account identifier to be created

|jdoe
|John Doe
|##Disabled##
|jdoe

|jsmith
|John Smith
|Enabled
|jsmith

|===


Visualisation notes:

* Search: filter uses as supported by standard user listing + ability to hide rows which are "OK"
* Ability to export the (interactive) view to Excel for further processing outside midPoint
* Top part of report ("summary panel"):
** How many accounts are missing (at least what midPoint thinks) and will be created (add operation)
** Display information that this is a simulation (? TODO ?)
* List of users:
** see the notes for *Columns* above

===== What will midPoint change in target system (AD)?

NOTE: This report should be executed after the reconciliation to have information about existing state.

TODO Implementation in midPoint: ? recomputation limited to target system (AD) with simulation mode ?

TODO Or could this perhaps use passive caching (reconciliation will be executed before this report anyway)?

The report (ideally interactive in Resource/Accounts, exportable to Excel) should contain the following information:

** Legend (example):
*** *+*: attribute value to be added (multi-value attribute)
*** *%*: attribute value to be replaced (single-value attribute)
*** *-*: attribute value to be removed (multi-value attribute)
** Maybe we could show at most X changes, to display more, administrator could "zoom in" by clicking. (Would need to be interactive report.)
** Maybe we could display even the values, but that would require multiple "zoom in". (Would need to be interactive report.)

Some kind of statistics, which account attributes are being added/deleted/changed to see the trends.

Visualisation notes:

* Top part of report ("summary panel"):
** How many accounts will be updated and will be created (modify operation)
** Which attributes (statistics) are to be updated most? We want to see the trends to diagnose possible problems in mappings.
** Display information that this is a simulation (? TODO ?)
* List of users:
** see the notes for *Columns* above

NOTE: The two reports for showing what midPoint would create and update can be also merged to one.
In that case some summary panel with statistics (no changes / additions / removals / updates) would be nice in report "summary panel".

[#side-by-side-report]
===== Side by side report (idea)

Started brainstorming with M. Spanik 10.3.2022.

Users (left) vs _their_ accounts (right).

Accounts without owners have empty user columns.

NOTE: For situations with many `DISPUTED` or `UNMATCHED` accounts, the table would be on multiple pages. Problem with matching accounts to users unless some searching is used on both panels (allowing administrator to work with specific subsets, e.g. John Smiths vs accounts containing smith in their usernames.)

Grouped by `SITUATION`, different background colors:

* linked with owner
* unlinked with showing _potential_ owner
* protected
* unmatched
* disputed
* deleted: not shown here, this is initial reconciliation
* *TODO for attribute changes (differences between user and account): new situation/color*

Columns left: configurable (view).

Columns right: configurable (view) if we can use data from shadows (passive caching).

Ability to search and hide rows to concentrate on problems. Example:

* hide all linked
* hide all linked and protected
* show only users matching `jsmith`

The list will be very long, so we need some filtering/searching.

*Ability to display details in both left and right views (ideally: together!)*

* when editing user (left) and account (right): action to link them together (*Link together*)

Ability to execute actions (later iterations) from resource definition (situations and reactions):

* unlinked, unmatched etc.
* disputed: specify owner (e.g. drag & drop) or whatever Identity Matching will allow us to do
** here Identity Matching can help
** *TODO how to display the columns users vs accounts for disputed without repeating either users or accounts? Below we have three categories: `UNMATCHED`, `DISPUTED` and `NO ACCOUNT`*
* no account: account can be created (assignments, policy etc.) or nothing will be done. Creation of account _may cause conflict_ as `extension/candidateUserName` is not guaranteed to be unique. ##This should be indicated here.##

==== How to connect HR to midPoint

* Select the source (HR) system: either CSV or DatabaseTable (for this kind of customers we need to avoid custom connectors or ScriptedSQL which requires coding as well)
* Agree on contents that is possible to export from source (HR) systems. Think of:
** Identifier (e.g. `employeeNumber`)
** E-mail (if it is already there - ideal for identity matching)
** *MAYBE IN LATER ITERATIONS* Basic entitlements/access rights (if it is there)
** Content
*** Full state of all active + inactive employees?
*** Full state, but only active employees?
*** *MAYBE IN LATER ITERATIONS* Agree on reactions (e.g. what to do if employee is removed from source export?)
* Let HR people export data to CSV file or DB table/view
* Choose *naming convention for midPoint users*. Think of:
** How the naming convention can help when correlating with target systems?
*** Ideally: the naming convention used in organization, e.g. in *AD*
*** People coming from HR maybe have AD account, but maybe not. If the naming convention is `jsmith`, we can create `jsmith` (for John Smith) and `jsmith2` (for Jack Smith) in midPoint, while in *AD* there can be `jsmith` (Joachim Smith) and `jsmith2` (John Smith) completely other (or mixed) users
** Is there any requirement for naming convention from the company? E.g. "it must be `jsmith` convention" or "it must be based on `employeeNumber` attribute" etc.
** *Initial naming convention in midPoint can use `employeeNumber` value - as a placeholder, ##temporary##* and we can reimport later to change the naming convention
*** Keep `employeeNumber` also in separate User attribute so we can rename users when reimporting if needed
** *Rado's idea (##NEW FEATURE REQUIRED##): initial naming convention - empty login name, which would require DB changes... ##temporarily## we will users without `name`*
** *Rado's idea: we can have `extension/candidateUserName` (non-unique!!!) filled by midPoint mapping*. All "J. Smiths" will have `jsmith` there. For many users this will match the target system convention directly
*** Users with the same `extension/candidateUserName` will most probably require manual correlation with target systems
* What about passwords?
** *For initial load it does not make sense, and maybe we do not need to have passwords in midPoint at all. AD password is set somehow even before midpoint*
** Generate random and how to distribute them?
** Using external authentication? Using AD
* *##NEW FEATURE REQUIRED##: midPoint Resource Wizard with drag&drop schema+schema handling (<<new-resource-wizard,mentioned above>>)*
** Prepare some basic mappings for basic attributes for source (HR)
*** `name`: select either attribute from HR (asIs) or select a function from functional library, e.g. `Generate unique login based on jsmith` (with iterations) or *##NEW FEATURE REQUIRED##* no login at all
*** `givenName`
*** `familyName`
*** ...
*** `extension/candidateUserName`: select either attribute from HR (asIs) or select a function from functional library, e.g. `Generate value using jsmith convention` (no iterations, may not be unique)
* *REPEAT UNTIL OK:*
** Import people data from HR to midpoint: check if we can import all of them (missing mandatory identifiers etc.)
** Fix inbound mappings if needed (probably only few iterations needed)
* *NOW WE HAVE MIDPOINT FILLED WITH SOURCE DATA (maybe with temporary `name` attribute as stated above*
** If correlation expression is still the same, there is no need for explicit repository cleanup between/after iterations - we can import / reconcile as many times as we want
** But we should have some way of cleanup - maybe "Delete all identities" functionality we already have, *##NEW FEATURE REQUIRED##* just put it somewhere more "visible"

=== Step 3: Automation

Finally, we have reliable data to build on.
What are we waiting for?

TODO

. *On-boarding automation* (provisioning).
TODO
Create new accouts for users.
Leave existing accounts "as is".
If your data are good, you may roll-out automatic account updates as well.
This is the right time to suspend your legacy on-boarding/provisionig process (e.g. scripts or manual processes).


. *Off-boarding automation* (de-provisioning).
TODO

. *Automate scans* for orphaned accounts.



*Goal*: Make on-boarding and off-boarding processes more efficient and reliable.
Save some money and improve efficiency by speeding up the processes.
However, the most important goal is enabled by _reliability_ of the automated processes.
Accounts belonging to off-boarded people are automatically disabled.
Orphaned accounts are reliably detected.
The most severe identity-related risks are addressed.


=== Iterations

TODO: describe how the add-clean-automate iterations work.

=== Things to be resolved later

* *TODO* what about any automatically assigned roles?
** This might be related to the source system as well - for conditions
** This requires role model to exist - at least application roles
* *TODO* what about role requesting and approvals?
** Even if this is done outside midPoint initially, or via manual / ticket
requests, the roles are represented by group membership or something similar
in the target systems
** MidPoint should not conflict with the roles/groups assigned by other means
** More specifically, midPoint should tolerate them
* *TODO* multiple account intents


== Current Situation


Summary of what is happening before they go for a solution like midPoint, what are they typical activities, what are the struggles.

Automatic scripts, on-demand executed scripts or manual intervention is used to support provisioning.
The processes are usually managed using tickets (or e-mails, in worst case).
Automation is partial, because is usually limited to the accounts and not to users (account owners).
Scripts are usually used "as is", they can be created by people no longer working in the company.
In that case, script modification/improvements can be costly.
Scripts can be executed in an automatic way = scheduled, if there is some connection to HR system.
On-demand executed scripts rely on decisions tracked in ticketing system.

Reaction to security incidents (e.g. bad leaver) can take long time (ticket)
or may require non-systematic solution (urgent phone call and later ticket - for evidence).

Account rename may be painful: some systems do not support rename at all, other require change of many attributes (e.g. AD: `sn`, `cn`, `dn`, `userPrincipalName`, `sAMAccountName`, `mail` / `proxyAddresses` including previous e-mail value as an alias...)

For leavers, some accounts are immediately deleted, some are disabled and/or moved within the directory tree and deferred actions need to be executed (allowing user's manager to access the mailbox, delayed delete, ...)

TODO yet more

=== Typical analysis process

The typical analysis is very limited in scope. It is mostly scratching the surface.

They are thinking about HR records as clean identities. Mostly thinking about people first, last names and how they are identified (not correlated).
Some are identifying by employee numbers. When connecting (correlating) records, even when employee number is entered into systems, there are typos or forgotten.
Sometimes they are identifying by first and last names or by loginname at best.

They are thinking about target system accounts, usually not as accounts owned by some users.
The accounts are managed by administrators of that resource or support teams,
their management is often isolated from the other provisioning teams.
There might be long unused (orphaned) accounts mixed with service and testing accounts.
Some scenarios are resolved "when they happen", e.g. what to do if account
name is already taken.



=== Obstacles (Problem Definition)

Why midPoint in its current state does not satisfy target customers?

Overall (high-level) obstacles:

* *High entry barrier*. Customer engineers have to learn too much. They won't. They do not have time/resources/skills for that.
+
High entry barrier makes midPoint *expensive* to deploy and operate, as _skilled_ people need to find a lot of time to dedicate midPoint.
This ruins the business case for midPoint deployment, i.e. midPoint total cost of ownership (*TCO*) is too high.
+
*Questions:* Can partners help? Can the customer afford assistance of partner? Is that enough? E.g. will partner _operate_ the system after deployment?

* *Missing methodology*. We do not have clear, simple and consistent set of instruction to deploy and use midPoint.
MidPoint is a chameleon, adapting to many situations.
This is confusing the engineers, they do not know _what_ to do, _where_ to start.

* *Old world vs new world*.
MidPoint is designed for _old world_ (servers, on-premise, integration, customization, scripting).
Yet, there is a brave _new world_ (cloud, services, plug-and-play drag-and-drop do-it-all as a service).
Some midPoint concepts fit well in the new world (e.g. git/devops/JSON), others do not (complexity, _need_ for customization).

* *Abstract thinking*:
MidPoint _requires_ abstract thinking.
Understanding to many abstract concepts (focus, shadow, abstract roles, assignments/inducements, policy rules) is essential to use midPoint efficiently.
However, this is too much to be handles by most engineers.
IT is much more complex than 10 years ago, engineers do not have time to understand each system intimately.
The result is that vast majority engineers that work with midPoint will not have sufficient understanding of the underlying concepts.
How to make them efficient even with such limited understanding?

Technological (low-level) obstacles:

* *Terminology*: MidPoint has its own vocabulary (shadow, focus, projection, ...), which is not common in IT field.
MidPoint has to have its own vocabulary, otherwise we could not develop/maintain it.
However, this is an obstacle for engineers.
MidPoint is meant to be used by _humans_ (engineers), presentation and usability is important.
How to align midPoint _development_ needs with the _usage_ needs?

* *Configuration vs Data*: part of the things that we store in midPoint are configuration (e.g. system config), which should be managed by devops configuration management.
Other part are data (e.g. users, accounts) that should NOT be managed by version control.
However, there is a big *gray zone*: roles, policy rules, object templates, mappings. It is not clear how to manage the _policies_.

* *Managing multiple environments*: customers usually need to deploy midPoint in multiple environments (e.g. `DEV`, `TEST`, `ACC`, `PROD`).
This basically means there are multiple midPoint deployments as midPoint in `DEV` is usually responsible for managing identities in `DEV` environment.
Management of configuration and data and their transfer/transformation between environments may be required.
E.g. (subset of) identity data from `PROD` should be transferred to `ACC` (after some anonymization) on a regular basis.

* *Complexity of schema*: There are too many configuration options and possibilities, many of them poorly documented.
It is difficult to figure out which option to use when.
It is difficult to find that some functionality/feature even exists at all.

* *Data representation (XML/JSON)*: Engineers are not used to write XML any more.
JSON is better, but it is still a problem (see the "schema" problem above).
Engineers should be able to do all the common tasks in GUI, without need for XML/JSON.

* *Hard to troubleshoot*: Error messages are often incomprehensible for average engineer and require deep understanding of midPoint (ability to analyze stack traces) or extremely large body of experiences from previous troubleshooting attempts (many times hours of trial-and-errors).
Typical example: using q:equal (instead of q:ref) when comparing references leads to cryptic ClassCastException or something like that.
And there are zillions of similar cases.


== Solution Ideas

Unstructured notes. Move to other parts/documents as necessary.

* *Allow direct access to database* (PostgreSQL only, read-only, with upgradeability disclaimers).
This may help to address unforeseen use-cases, with technology/toolset that the engineers already know (SQL).
The risk to upgradeability is relatively low, as we have to keep DB data model (mostly) backwards-compatible anyway.

* *Improved default configuration*: pre-configure midPoint for the usual use-cases.
How exactly?
Better _samples_? Pre-configured _profiles_?
** Resource mappings-related: we can prepare function libraries (see also below) with most-common code usable for mappings. Admin will simply select one of the functions.

* *Improved user experience*: How exactly? For who? Engineers? End users? How skilled? What use-cases?

* *Improved documentation*: how exactly? What documentation? For who? Which format? text? video?

* *"Complexity spectrum" approach*: +
Simple and common tasks should be very easy to do (few click in GUI). +
Medium-complexity and less-common tasks should still be relatively easy (still GUI, but may be more click and complex forms/flows, even writing one-liner expression, but still in GUI). +
Complex and uncommon tasks may need deeper expertise/experience (e.g. editing JSON/XML). +
Exotic tasks should still be possible, but may require programming (e.g. complex scripts, plugins, Maven overlay, etc.). +
This approach was there since the beginning of midPoint, it is one of the design principles.
Yet, it may not be well documented, and it might have been neglected sometime.

* *From scientific to engineering approach*:
+

Mapping definition
[x] Use reasonable defaults

MidPoint attribute mappings will be by default:
(*) Tolerant
        Other values of single-value attributes are permitted
        Other values of multi-value attributes are permitted
( ) Enforcing
        Other values of single-value attributes are not permitted (midPoint overwrites such values)
        Other values of multi-value attributes are not permitted (midPoint removes such values)

MidPoint group membership mappings will be by default:
(*) Tolerant
        Group membership managed by other means is permitted and tolerated
( ) Enforcing
        Group membership managed by other means is not permitted (midPoint removes such values)
----

* *Complete automation* vs *Human task automation*:
Do we want midPoint to do everything automatically (read from HR, process policies, create accounts).
Or do we want midPoint to manage people that do it manually (review HR data, approve requests, create tickets for admins to create accounts)?
We probably want both, but to what degree? What we will be recommending? (methodology)

[#new-resource-wizard]
=== New resource wizard step by step usage

* Assumption: for resources such as `AD`, there will be predefined configuration for some basic attributes/mappings, such as:
** `dn` using "dynamic" suffix definition - e.g. using `basic.getResourceIcfConfigurationPropertyValue(resource, 'baseSuffix')`
** `cn`
** `sn`
** `givenName`
** `userPrincipalName` using "dynamic" suffix definition derived from `baseSuffix`. Example:
*** if `baseSuffix` is `cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com`, `userPrincipalName` will be ending with `@example.com`
*** *TODO implementation detail: how to derive this reliably*
** `administrativeStatus`
* Assumption: there will be a *##NEW FEATURE REQUIRED##* functional library object defined in midPoint repository (may be even in default initial objects, or a combination of one from initial object and another one(s) custom) - and multiple may be referenced from resource
** the functional library will contain simple functions whose names will be
displayed instead of XML code, usable for most of the attribute mappings, such as:
*** copy value
*** normalize
*** lowercase
*** uppercase
*** DN, with `cn=GivenName FamilyName`
*** DN, with `cn=FamilyName\, GivenName`
*** ... other, to be added by the administrator if defaults are not enough ...
** in all cases, when selecting a function for mapping, midPoint should show the administrator description of the function, and example. Perhaps even example based on real user data? (Some selected user)
* Resource configuration step: enter connection defaults. As few as really
required, such as:
** Hostname/IP/URL
** Service account username
** Service account password
** Base suffix (may be auto-detected?)
* Schema step (containing both schema and schema handling): showing arrows between midPoint and resource attributes (mapping
direction) and mapping summary for each arrow
** If the predefined schema handling is not OK, administrator can customize by:
*** drag&drop midPoint attribute to account attribute (left to right) = outbound
*** drag&drop account attribute to midPoint attribute (right to left) = inbound
** Clicking the arrows can be used to update the default mappings by
selecting from the mappings present in functional library
** *##NEW FEATURE REQUIRED##* global definition for mapping strength to be inherited by the mappings instead of defaulting to `normal`?
*** we would need this to be either `normal` or *##NEW FEATURE REQUIRED## new value e.g. `preview`* so that we can use `preview` first, then switch to `normal` and who wants `strong` can do that here
* Correlation / confirmation / identity matching step
** preconfigured, e.g. `userPrincipalName` equals midPoint
`extension/candidateUserName` or `employeeNumber` equals `employeeNumber`
** possibly preconfigured for "reverse identity matching" by selecting which
attribute mappings should match the existing resource values (e.g. `cn`, `sn`
and `givenName`)
** mapping "guessing" based on correlation:
*** midPoint will compare e.g. 50 users and 50 accounts to see if the correlation expression matches
*** mappings for simple cases can be derived from these matches
*** midPoint can make sure the mappings are OK as configured (that they provide the same values as there are on resource already)
* Reporting of correlation/matching (read-only)
** start iterations for the resource re-configuration now
** based on the results of the correlation/matching, we need to distinguish
*data quality issues* vs *bad correlation expression*
*** e.g. 5% users not matched: policy is OK, let's do manual correlation
*** e.g. 80% users not matched: probably invalid correlation expression, do
not do any manual correlation yet
** the report/output needs to clearly state the following:
*** which account...
*** ... seems to have owner and which one...
*** ... and *why*! (what part of correlation matched, what's the probability)
*** and also which accounts do not have owner in midPoint...
*** ... and what would *happen to them* (e.g. they would be deleted)

Basically we can either "guess" correlation if we specify which user owns
which account, or we specify correlation and midPoint can "guess" the
mappings. (At least to some extent.)  Maybe we can have a combination, if
administrator selected one user and one account that is owned by the user,
midPoint can suggest correlation expression. Then midPoint can check more
accounts, try to correlate with users and guess the mappings for simple
cases...


When the resource accounts can be matched, we need to run simulation report to know: *what would be changed when the system is connected* (because of mappings).
The report needs to show the following:

* for matched/linked accounts: show what would happen, which changes would midPoint do
** *##NEW FEATURE REQUIRED##*: present delta in some more compact and user-friendly way. Maybe on two levels: show there will be changes and of how many attributes and then you can go to details for that particular situation
* for unlinked accounts: show what would happen to these accounts
* for unmatched accounts: show what would happen to these accounts
* for deleted accounts: show what would happen to these accounts

In general, admin must have confidence what *would happen*.

Then, real reconciliation can be executed followed by running the report again.


== Why MidPoint?

Why we think midPoint is the best tool for this kind of approach?

* MidPoint is open source platform.
There is a very little up-front investment.
There are no licence costs that need to be paid before project starts.

* MidPoint is completely open.
All the software is publicly available as well as all the documentation.
The very first steps (e.g. prototyping) can be done by internal staff, without a need for expensive consulting services.

* MidPoint is available immediately.
Just xref:https://evolveum.com/download/[download it] and try it out.
No need to do any paperwork, no need to sign any contracts, no need to request access to software.
You do not even have to register, or agree to unintelligible terms of use.
Just go ahead, click the link and try it now.

* Professional support. TODO.

== What's Next

Where does it lead? -> IGA (Set up roles and policies, manage applications, entitlements, organizational structure, etc.) ... once the solution is mature enough
