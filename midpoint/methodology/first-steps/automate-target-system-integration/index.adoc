You now have source and target resource systems connected and data synchronized to consistency between them.
When attributes for a user change in the source HRIS system, your midPoint configuration can propagate the changes to the target.
It is now the time to automate some of the provisioning processes to increase the autonomy of your configuration.

** The first thing to do is to *automate username generation*.
    Using those in LDAP does not work for new users as they do not have an account in the target LDAP resource yet.
    The solution is to let midPoint generate the usernames and provision them to the target resource.
