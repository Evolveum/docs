:page-description: Guide on resetting your training environment when you wish to repeat the course and begin with a blank slate

Should you decide to go through the whole First steps guide again, you may want to reset the training environment.
This is only applicable if you used the preconfigured Docker images we provide as part of the link:https://evolveum.com/training-and-certification/midpoint-deployment-first-steps-self-paced/[MID-301 First steps training course].

. Go to the directory into which you have unpacked the `firststeps.zip` with the Docker images.
. Stop and remove the Docker container: `docker compose down -v`
    ** The `-v` parameter instructs Docker to delete the containers, volumes, and networks.
        Without the parameter, Docker only stops the containers and you can resume them as you left them.
. Start the whole training environment anew: `docker compse up -d`

In a few moments, you can connect to the training applications.
