Everything is now ready for import.
Before you proceed with the real import, it's best to _simulate_ the action first and see if everything behaves as expected.

== Simulate first

. You first simulate importing one account.
    Refer to the xref:/midpoint/reference/tasks/synchronization-tasks/import-and-reconciliation/gui/#simulate-import-of-a-single-object[guide on import preview] for details.
. Then, try it with all accounts.
    ** Refer to the xref:/midpoint/reference/tasks/synchronization-tasks/import-and-reconciliation/gui/[guide on creating tasks in GUI].
	** Select icon:upload[] btn:[Import task] and switch on the *Simulate task* toggle to activate simulation mode.
    ** Use _Preview_ mode with the _Development_ configuration in the xref:/midpoint/reference/tasks/synchronization-tasks/import-and-reconciliation/gui#execution[execution setup screen].
    ** xref:/midpoint/reference/tasks/synchronization-tasks/import-and-reconciliation/gui/#read-simulation-results[Inspect the simulation results] and rectify the resource configuration if needed.
	** You may notice a discrepancy between the number of your resource objects and the number of to-be imported people.
		That's expected if link:#mapping-script[your mapping sets some people as inactive].
. Finally, after you get expected results during the simulation,
	set up a *new import task* using the same steps as above. +
	Now, however, with the *simulation toggle switched off* to run the actual real import.

Refer to xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/simulations/[] for guidance on interpreting simulation results.

[TIP]
====
We strongly suggest you *don't skip the simulation steps*.
It's the best way to make sure your resource configuration behaves as expected and fix it if needed.

== Import for real

Once you confirm you get the expected results during the simulations, you can *import the users for real*:

. Make sure you have all relevant objects in the _Active_ lifecycle state:
    ** The whole resource
    ** The object type for accounts
    ** Mapping rules
    ** Synchronization rules
	** You can use the icon:heart-pulse[] btn:[Check detailed lifecycle] button in the top menu within the resource to view a list of individual resource components and their current lifecycle states.
. Create the same import task you used for simulation but this time with the *simulation toggle switched off*, i.e., use the _Undefined_ execution mode with _Production_ configuration.
    ** With the *Simulate task* toggle off, you won't see the *Execution* screen and midPoint uses the production settings automatically.
. Check the imported accounts in the icon:male[] Accounts section of your resource.
. You can find all imported users also under icon:user[role="red"] *Users* > icon:user[] *Persons*.

If you see a list similar to the one above―congratulations, you've imported your users to midPoint and you're ready to connect a target system to midPoint.

You may ask if it's OK to have employee numbers as names of users instead of their real names.
Good and timely question.
It's up to you, but generally, it's better to use usernames as use object identifiers (names).
In this guide, we're going to use the LDAP resource covered in the next sections as a source for usernames because, unlike the HR system, the LDAP resource contains the usernames.
