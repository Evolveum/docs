== Provision Accounts to Target Systems

. Create outbound mappings for the target system (module 7, 7:30)
i   .. simulate first
. Activation - veci jako deactivate instead of delete a delayed delete
. Credentials - poskytuje hesla do LDAP

At this point, you have the identities in your systems mostly correlated.
Up until now, when your HR created, updated, or deactivated a user in the HR information system (HRIS),
someone also had to go and do the same to that user in the target LDAP system.

The logical next step now is to automate the process.
That means to automatically:

* Create account in LDAP based on the data in HRIS.
    ** Create the first password for the new user in LDAP.
* Update accounts in LDAP according to changes that happen in HRIS.
* Suspend and possibly delete accounts for users suspended in or deleted from HRIS.

There are several tools in midPoint you are going to use for these tasks: outbound activation, outbound credentials, and outbound mappings.
When you are done with this setup, it is no longer necessary to manually update user accounts in the target system:
you do the change once in the authoritative HR system and midPoint propagates it automatically to all configured target systems.

=== Create outbound mapping rules for LDAP

Firstly, to enable provisioning to the LDAP target system, you need outbound mapping rules.
Outbound mapping rules work the same as inbound mappings, they merely map the data the other way round: _from_ midPoint _to_ the target system.

* Refer to this guide on creating mapping rules: xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/mapping/#outbound_mappings[]
* Use outbound mappings because youâ€™re pushing attributes _to_ the resource _from_ midPoint.
* The list of rules below is for illustration purposes.
    The actual attributes you need to map depend on your target system.

If you are "faking" the LDAP resource using a CSV file loaded via the CSV connector, you need to use the following script for the DN construction instead.
This is because the built-in `getResourceIcfConfigurationPropertyValue` method works for LDAP resources, but not for CSV resources.

return cn
----

=== Activate users in the target system

Activation in midPoint is the state of an object, such as user, account, or entitlement.
Activation is based on several properties, namely _administrative status_, _valid from_, _valid to_, and _lifecycle status_.
Based on the values of these object attributes, midPoint computes an xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/activation/#effective-status[*effective status*].

We can use effective status in *outbound activation mapping* to _activate_ or _deactivate_ accounts on resources, such as an LDAP system.

Refer to xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/activation/[] for the full documentation activation.

*Refer to xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/activation/[instructions on working with activation in the midPoint GUI]*.

In total, create *three activation outbound mappings*:

* icon:id-card-clip[] *Administrative status*
    ** *Lifecycle state*: _Proposed_
    ** *Name*: _account-status-based-on-mp-user_, for example.
    ** *Strength*: _Strong_
    ** You can leave *Source* empty because midPoint already knows the default source for this mapping (effective status).
    ** The activation mapping controls the account status in the target system based on the effective status of the respective focal object in midPoint.
* icon:user-slash[] *Disable instead of delete*
    ** *Lifecycle state*: _Proposed_
    ** This ensures that illegal accounts don't get deleted but rather disabled.
        It's best to use this in conjunction with the Delayed delete configuration.
* icon:clock[] *Delayed delete*
    ** *Lifecycle state*: _Proposed_
    ** Set *Delete after* to a value appropriate to your use case.
    ** Accounts marked for deletion will deleted no sooner than after the grace period set here elapses.
        *** For testing, sensible values are in minutes.
        *** For production, sensible values are likely weeks or months.

=== Create initial passwords in the target system

When you provision accounts to target systems, you need to take care of users' initial passwords.
There may be at least two reasons:

* Some systems refuse to create a user with a blank password.
* Without a password, the new user would either be unable to log in at all,
    or the system would let them in without a password.
    Neither of which is likely a behavior you want.

That means midPoint needs to supply an initial password for new accounts.
It's up to the app using the target system to require a password change upon the first login.

Moreover, you may let your users change their password directly in midPoint.
In such a case, you need to tell midPoint to propagate the changed password to the target system.

*Refer to xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/credentials/[instructions on working with credentials in the midPoint GUI]*.

For the purposes of the setup we're building in this guide, you are going to use two outbound mappings for credentials:

* Generate an initial password for new accounts.
    ** *Lifecycle state*: _Proposed_
    ** *Name*: _initial-passwd-generate_, for example.
    ** *Stregth*: _Weak_
    ** *Expression*: _Generate_
    ** This mapping needs to be _weak_ so that it doesn't overwrite any existing password. +
        Weak mapping is used only when the target attribute has no value.
* Copy password from midPoint to the resource in case a user changes the password in midPoint.
    ** *Lifecycle state*: _Proposed_
    ** *Name*: _passwd-change_, for example.
    ** *Stregth*: _Normal_
    ** *Expression*: _As is_
    ** If your users are not expected to ever use midPoint to change their passwords, you don't need this mapping.

Refer to these resources for more information on credentials:

* xref:/midpoint/reference/security/credentials/[]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/credentials/[]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/security/credentials/password-policy/[]

explanation: explanatory video, module 7, 10:47

=== Simulate provisioning

As always, before you put the new settings to production, simulate first to see if you get expected results.
If you followed this Methodology from the start, you already have a xref:/midpoint/methodology/first-steps/connect/#reconcile-your-ldap-accounts[task for a simulated reconciliation] ready.
If not, create it according to the linked guidance.

After you run the simulated reconciliation, check the simulation results.
You may see some accounts are renamed on either side as midPoint is trying to fix the data and make them consistent.

If some results are not as expected, adjust the resource configurations as needed.
You can run the simulation over and over again safely, it doesn't touch your data.

=== Put the LDAP Provisioning into Production

Having inspected and verified the results of the simulation,
it is turn them into reality.

For that to happen, you need to move all the mappings (the "regular" ones, as well as those for activation, and credentials) from the _Proposed_ lifecycle state to _Active_.

After that, run the production reconciliation task in the LDAP resource.

You have turned on configuration for provisioning to the target LDAP resource for all attributes, as well as activation and passwords.
You don't have yet set up an automatic synchronization between the source and target resources, that is, the HR and LDAP.
However, your configuration is almost ready for that and we'll get to that very soon.

explanation in explanatory video, module 7: 18:16

== Automate the processes

After the steps you've done up to now, your LDAP and HR data can be considered reasonably clean and in sync.
With that, you can *move on to automating the setup* so that it works autonomously:

* Periodically check the HR system and import new accounts, if any.
* Regularly check the LDAP system and clean up (delete) any illicit accounts.
* Provision LDAP accounts for new employees imported from HR.
* Create passwords for new HR accounts when provisioned to LDAP.

=== Generate Usernames in MidPoint

Up until now, we've used the employee number from the HR system and the UID attribute from the LDAP system for user names.

Now, it's time to configure midPoint to let it create usernames on its own so that it can provide LDAP accounts to new users created in in the HR system.
That's because if a new person joins the organization, they don't have an LDAP account, meaning there's nowhere to take their username from.

For midPoint to be an authoritative source of new usernames, you need to take a couple of steps:

* Disable the HR inbound mapping _empnum-to-name_ which takes the `empnum` attribute and uses it for the focus `name` attribute.
* Disable the LDAP inbound mapping _inbound-uid-username-to-name_ which takes the `uid` attribute and uses it for the focus `name` attribute.
* Activate the _Person object template_ that can generate usernames based on the focal object name and surname.

==== Disable the obsolete inbound mappings for name

. For the *HR resource*:
    .. In the HR resource, go to xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/mapping/[mapping configuration].
    .. In *Inbound mappings*, set the _empnum-to-name_ mapping to the _Archived_ lifecycle state
    .. Save the configuration.

. For the *LDAP resource*:
    .. In the LDAP resource, go to xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/mapping/[mapping configuration].
    .. In *Inbound mappings*, set the _inbound-uid-username-to-name_ mapping to the _Archived_ lifecycle state
    .. Save the configuration.

==== Activate the Person object template mapping for usernames



- enable mapping in object template
    - object template in MP is an object that allows running mappings whenever a focal object based on the template is created (e.g., user)
    - can be either global (for specific focus type, e.g., user), or archetype-specific (e.g., for Person)
        - there's a built-in object template for the Person archetype in MP - contains 2 default mappings - generate-fullname and generate-name-jsmith-8-2 (with iterator)
            - this Person object template is tied to the Person archetype which is used for everybody we import from the HR system.
            - various users can have various archetypes which can induce different behavior
        - the username generator jsmith is weak so it only generates the value when the attribute is empty and doesn't change it when the person changes their name (e.g., when married)
        - object template mappings work only with focal objects, they have focal object attributes on both sides
        - if you want to enforce the values, make the mappings strong (e.g., full name)
- disable HR inbound mapping for name
- disable LDAP inbound mapping for name - LDAP is no more the source system for us

- to automate sync with HR, we need a reconciliation task that is set to run repeatedly in given intervals (minutes, hours, ... can also be cron-ed); otherwise the task is the same
- to automate LDAP account creation, we need to make MP create them
    - important to understand concepts of assignment and inducements:
        - assignment is a policy, a decision that an object (e.g., user) should have something (e.g., a role)
        - inducement is an indirect assignment - object (inducement) assigned to a user causes the user to have something (e.g. a role or account)
        - rule of thumb: users have assignments (roles, orgs, services, accounts, archetypes, ..); roles, orgs, services, accounts, archetypes have inducements - they cause something to happen to users who have them assigned (access rights, accounts, ...)
    - archetype can be considered a birth right and we'll add LDAP provisioning to the Person archetype - resource account construction inducement in the Person archetype
        - video: module 8: 22:45
        - video 25:10 - mappings in the archetype which we won't use, but may be worth mentioning?
- Entitlements and associations
    - accounts are resource objects representing resource accounts
        - entitlement - resource object representing resource privelage, e.g., AD group
        - entitlements can be associated with accounts ==> membership
        - provisioning manages entitlements, i.e., provisioning translates association into account--entitlement relation
        - entitlements are resource objects like accounts with their own kind and intent
    - associations are configured in resource account object type (can be predefined in object template)
    - two possible ways for associations (28:58):
        - roles are pointing to users (objectToSubject)
        - users pointing to roles (subjectToObject)
    - midPoint doesn't store role memberships, it fetches the info on demand - searches all the groups for a user DN, for example.
        - Q: does that apply to 4.9+ as well? (with all the caching and such)
    - lifecycle states:
        - long-term leaves - account is suspended in MP -> disabled in LDAP
        - former employees - account is archived in MP -> deleted in LDAP -- but with disabled instead of delete + delayed delete

how delayed delete works
    - MP creates a trigger when the account is supposed to be deleted, is stored in account shadow
    - MP recalculates the account and deletes
    - trigger scanner scans timestamps and triggers the actions (usually runs in 5 minutes intervals ??? - what if the delay is only 2 minutes?)

- assignments and inducements enforce policies - if an object (e.g., user) should have something, e.g., a role, MP ensures that; creates the resource account and populates it with the right data, manages attributes of groups etc.
    - strong mappings ensure that MP enforces the correct values even if someone changes them in the target system - MP is authoritative

- during the migration to MP, MP can be set to tolerate group membership changes by external (legacy) systems; after the migration is done, MP can be set as intolerant
- when you turn on the automatic provisioning to AD via MP, don't forget to turn off provisioning to LDAP via legacy systems
- validity check scanner - runs each 15 minutes and checks validFrom and validTo to compute effective state (not used in this training)
- shadow refresh task (basically simplified reconciliation) - if MP has some changes cached in shadow objects which it couldn't have pushed previously to resource because it was down, for example, shadow refresh task triggers maintenance operations to push these changes to resource; also cleans up dead shadows after their retention period (by default 7 days)
    - dead shadow: when account is deleted on target system but shadow exists in MP. All the associations still exist, account can be recreated based on the dead shadow.

.Goal
TIP: Asses the _real_ data quality, determine practical next steps.
At this point we know what we _really_ have, what we can build on, what needs to be improved.
We can identify the most severe security risks, such as orphaned accounts.
Now we can improve our plan, adding more details based on the _real_ data.

You have some kind of HR data now.
In theory, you should use the HR data to create and manage accounts in target system, such as your Active Directory.
However, in practice, this is not entirely straightforward.

Firstly, it is almost certain that there are errors and inaccuracies in the HR data.
The data were maintained manually for a long time, with no way for automatic validation.
Mistakes in the data might be buried deep, surviving undetected for decades.
Having nothing to compare the data with, there is no telling how good or bad the data are.

Secondly, the data in your target systems (especially Active Directory) certainly leave a lot to be desired.
These were managed manually for years, with no automatic way to make sure theyâ€™re correct.
There will be account belonging to people that left your organizations years ago.
There will be accounts using maiden names of women that are married now.
There will be strange accounts and identifiers that originated ages ago when your organization was still small and system administration was fun.
There may be all kinds of weirdness and historical baggage frozen in time because nobody remembers what it does and everybody is scared to touch it.

In general, when deploying identity management system to an existing environment, we need to take extra care of the following:

. *usernames*: midPoint usernames should be the same as for the principal authentication system. In this methodology, we assume that company's Active Directory or LDAP which will be connected as the first target system is used as the source of usernames.
. *accounts*: we shouldnâ€™t harm any existing accounts in an unexpected way
. *passwords*: we shouldnâ€™t alter (e.g. re-generate) any existing account password

Taking HR data and simply forcing them to Active Directory will never work.
We need much smarter approach.

// TODO: short summary of the process

This is what you have to do:

=== Connect HR System

*Connect HR* data source to midPoint.
Set up your HR identity resource in midPoint, using CSV or DatabaseTable connector.

.Please refer to the following documentation:

* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/[]

You can see this step in action in the First Steps Methodology webinar video:

video::suo775ym_PE[youtube,title="Step 2: Connect Source System (HR)",start="1216"]

Deal with just the very basic data items for now:

* Names (given name, family name)
* Employee number, student number or similar identifier
* Status (active, former employee, alumni, etc.) and/or validity date/time (based on contract etc.)

You can ignore other fields for now.
We can get back to them later.

The resource is created in `Proposed` lifecycle status by default.
Keep it that way at this stage.

We recommend to use resource capabilities to disable `Create`, `Update` and `Delete` operations on the resource.

Create a new object type for HR accounts to allow creation of users in midPoint with `Person` archetype assigned.

.Please refer to the following documentation:

* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/#object-type-configuration[Resource wizard - part Object type configuration]

WARNING: Make sure you select the proper archetype before importing the users. Change of archetype is not supposed to be a straightforward process as archetypes are expected to work as object classes in the future.

Preview your HR records which will be imported to see if you want to import all of them, or you want to import only a subset of them using a classification filter (e.g. if you want to ignore non-IT personnel).
While the resource is in `Proposed` lifecycle state, you can redefine classification filters and reclassify your HR accounts as many times as you wish.

[#import-users-from-hr]
===  Import Users From HR To MidPoint

*Import users* to midPoint, using HR data.
For simplicity, use HR person identifier (e.g. employee number) as the midPoint username.
We will import the usernames from AD/LDAP later.

.Please refer to the following documentation:

* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/#wizard-for-task-creation[Resource wizard - part Wizard for task creation]

You can see this step in action in the First Steps Methodology webinar video:

video::suo775ym_PE[youtube,title="Step 3: Import from HR",start="1541"]

//Select appropriate algorithm for midPoint username.
//You surely have some username convention (such as `jsmith`) in place.

Start with importing a single HR account with preview option to see how the user would be created in midPoint.
Then you can xref:/midpoint/reference/simulation/[simulate] the import of all HR accounts using a simulated import task running with _Development_ configuration to see how all the users would be created in midPoint.

You can continually improve your imported data by adding more attribute mappings.

When finished, switch the HR resource to `Active` lifecycle state.

.Please refer to the following documentation:

* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/#how-to-use-lifecycle-state[Resource wizard - part How to use lifecycle state]

WARNING: Make sure youâ€™ve selected the proper archetype for users before importing them. Change of archetype is not supposed to be a straightforward process as archetypes are expected to work as object classes in the future.

Now you can import the HR data, creating user objects in midPoint.
As weâ€™re working with simple data for now, the import should go well.

.User lifecycle
[NOTE]
====
This is where user lifecycle management starts.

We need at least some basic framework for user lifecycle management at this point.

If we can identify inactive (former) HR persons, we can utilize this information when checking for accounts in target systems that shouldnâ€™t be there (if we donâ€™t import inactive users from HR, we will see their accounts in target systems as simply orphaned).
====

Instead of setting user's `administrativeStatus`, we recommend to set midPoint user's `lifecycleState` property based on HR data as either:

* active
* suspended (e.g. temporarily inactive employees - parental leave, long-term sickness etc.)
* archived (e.g. former employees)

.If you have imported users with incorrect archetype
[NOTE]
====
If youâ€™ve managed to import users from source system with an incorrect archetype, please do the following:

. Delete all imported users from midPoint (make sure you donâ€™t delete `administrator` user)
.. midPoint will attempt to delete the source accounts in HR as well, if you have disabled `Create`, `Update` and `Delete` operations in resource capabilities, errors will be displayed (this is expected)
. Re-configure HR resource to use a correct archetype for user creation.
. Re-run the import task from HR resource.
====

[#connect-active-directory]
=== Connect Active Directory

*Set up your Active Directory (or LDAP) identity resource* in midPoint and keep it in `Proposed` lifecycle state.
Create Object type definition for AD accounts and keep it in `Proposed` lifecycle state as well.

.Please refer to the following documentation:

* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/[]

TIP: You can see this step in action in https://youtu.be/suo775ym_PE?t=1898&si=In5OAmPHUM9p7YdW[Step 4: Connect Target System in the First Steps Methodology Webinar] video.

You can see this step in action in the First Steps Methodology webinar video:

video::suo775ym_PE[youtube,title="Step 4: Connect Target System",start="1898"]

Set up outbound mappings for the small data set that youâ€™ve (given name, username and so on) and keep them in `Draft` lifecycle state (effectively disabled).

Configure correlation rules for AD accounts.

Configure synchronization configuration in `Proposed` lifecycle state.

We donâ€™t want to change any data in Active Directory yet.

.Please refer to the following documentation:

* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/#synchronization[Resource wizard - part Synchronization]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/#correlation[Resource wizard - part Correlation]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/#mappings[Resource wizard - part Mappings]

.Resource templates
[NOTE]
====
Resource templates can be prepared in advance.

Creating a new resource based on resource template instead of creating it from scratch can save your time as the basic configuration would be pre-defined, and you can enable/update it as necessary.
====

TIP: Please refer to our https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/tree/master/samples/resources/ad-ldap/AD[Active Directory resource sample] for more information. This sample was tested with our First Steps Methodology.


===  Correlate Active Directory Accounts

*Correlate Active Directory accounts* with midPoint users.
If you have employee numbers (or similar unique attributes from HR) stored in your Active Directory, then use that for correlation.
As an alternative if no such data can be used or if data is unreliable, you may want to use several attributes for _approximate_ correlation such as names, locality, department etc.
Manual confirmation using midPoint correlation cases can be used to specify midPoint user who should own the Active Directory account if the match is ambiguous.

.Please refer to the following documentation:
* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/#synchronization[Resource wizard - part Synchronization]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/#correlation[Resource wizard - part Correlation]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/#wizard-for-task-creation[Resource wizard - part Wizard for task creation]


You can see this step in action in the First Steps Methodology webinar video:

video::suo775ym_PE[youtube,title="Step 5: Target System Integration",start="2027"]


After configuring correlation and synchronization (while the resource, object type and synchronization configuration is in `Proposed` lifecycle state):

//Otherwise, use the generated midPoint usernames (e.g. `jsmith` convention) as the correlation identifier to match //(assumed) majority of the accounts to their corresponding owners in midPoint:

. Run the simulated _reconciliation_ task on AD resource using _Development_ configuration.
. Then have a look at the task and simulation results in midPoint GUI (interactively).

If you maintained your identifier assignment conventions reasonably well, most identities should correlate well.
MidPoint will show you correlation statistics for your accounts.

Of course, if the correlation is not able to use the personal/employee numbers, just users' names, there will be problems of `John Smith` and `Josh Smith` with their `jsmith` and `jsmith42` accounts.
Let's leave that for later.
For now just focus on correlating the bulk of users.

If you get 80-90% users to correlate well, youâ€™re done here.

There will be also orphaned accounts (`Unmatched` synchronization situation).
Based on your resource configuration, midPoint may report they will be deactivated (but weâ€™re still in `Proposed` lifecycle state - just simulating).

We will analyze the accounts here, but we will take final decision later in <<Clean Up The Accounts>> to not stop us from progressing.

TIP: You can analyze/clean up the data in several iterations.

The orphaned accounts generally fall into the following categories:

. *Obviously orphaned accounts*:
Review the list of orphaned accounts (the accounts in Active Directory not having an owner in midPoint which should mean they arenâ€™t related to HR data on which midPoint data is based) one by one and make sure these arenâ€™t_ system accounts (see the _System (service) accounts_ category).
+
Be careful if your HR system doesnâ€™t contain/export former employees data; in such situation you will not have the former employees in midPoint as users and their Active Directory accounts will be also considered orphaned.
+
If youâ€™re absolutely sure the accounts should be deactivated, you donâ€™t need to mark them and leave them to their (later) fate.

. *Orphaned accounts of unclear origin*:
Review the list of orphaned accounts (the accounts in Active Directory not having an owner in midPoint which should mean they arenâ€™t related to HR data on which midPoint data is based) one by one and make sure these arenâ€™t_ system accounts (see the _System (service) accounts_ category).
+
xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/mark/[_Mark_ the undesired ones as Decommission later] to be deactivated eventually (but not yet).

. *System (service) accounts*:
For all accounts that are crucial for Active Directory, we need a different decision.
+
xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/mark/[_Mark_ the system accounts as Protected in midPoint] to keep track of them, but ignore them otherwise by midPoint.

. *Accounts unmatched because of data inconsistencies.*
Review the rest of accounts which havenâ€™t been matched or decided in the previous steps.
This is the time to take care of the Smiths, Johnsons and Browns if no reasonably unique attribute could have been used for their correlation.
If possible, update your correlation configuration to use more attributes to find matching users (e.g. Given name, Family name, Location, ...).
+
You can also try to figure out which account belongs to which user and correlate them manually.
+
Or you can mark specific accounts as "Correlate later" to ignore them now and resolve them in later iteration.
+
If you did the previous steps well, there should be just a handful of them.
+
Sometimes there are several accounts (or groups of accounts) which need to be reviewed in more detail and remedied.
To avoid getting stuck in this phase, you may simply mark these accounts for later review ("Donâ€™t touch") and ignore any provisioning for them fow now.
(This is actually similar to the concepts of protected accounts, but having a different mark allows us to differentiate the accounts. We want them marked only temporarily, and they will be reported.)

TIP: We recommend to *review the accounts marked in previous iterations* to avoid a constant increase of their numbers.

After youâ€™ve finished marking of your accounts, you can run the simulated _reconciliation_ task with _Development_ configuration again.
Your marked accounts shouldnâ€™t be reported to be deactivated anymore.
Orphaned accounts which arenâ€™t marked should be still reported as to be deactivated.

Switch the resource, object type configuration and all synchronization actions except for `Unmatched` situation to `Active` lifecycle state.
Switch the synchronization action for `Unmatched` situation to `Draft` lifecycle state (to keep the reaction temporarily disabled), and:

. Run the simulated _reconciliation_ task on AD resource using _Production_ configuration.
. Then have a look at the simulation results in midPoint GUI (interactively). Orphaned accounts shouldnâ€™t be touched anymore - we will resolve them later, the synchronization configuration for them won't be used now (just in simulations).

Correlate the majority of your accounts now:

. Run the _reconciliation_ task on AD resource.
. Check the correlation statistics (watch for *Linked* situation)
. Majority of your accounts should be linked to their midPoint owners.


Of course, youâ€™re doing this for the first time.
Chances are that you havenâ€™t got all your configuration exactly right at the first try.
You may even need to update your HR resource configuration (e.g. if you forgot to import employee number) and reimport HR data.
Therefore, we assume you will work in iterations.
Simulations will guide you all the way.

=== Import Active Directory usernames

Until now, users in midPoint have been created with employee number (or similar) attribute from HR.
But your users already have Active Directory usernames.
We can reuse them also for midPoint users - the advantage will be more obvious later, if we switch the midPoint authentication mechanism to use Active Directory.

.Please refer to the following documentation:
* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/#mappings[Resource wizard - part Mappings]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/#wizard-for-task-creation[Resource wizard - part Wizard for task creation]


You can see this step in action in the First Steps Methodology webinar video:

Re-configure the original HR inbound mapping for midPoint username: set its strength to _weak_.
This allows to still create midPoint users who have no Active Directory account, but AD username will have higher priority.

Re-configure your Active Directory resource: add a new _inbound_ mapping from AD's login attribute to midPoint username.
The mapping will be created as _strong_ by default, to take precedence over HR, but keep the mapping lifecycle state `Proposed` (simulation) for now.

Simulate the username import:

. Run the simulated or  _reconciliation_ task on AD resource using _Development_ configuration (as the mapping we're interested in is in `Proposed` lifecycle state).
. Then have a look at the simulation results in midPoint GUI (interactively).

For all users with Active Directory account, midPoint will indicate username change.
Inspect the changes and fix the username mapping in Active Directory if needed.

Re-configure your Active Directory inbound mapping: set it to `Active` lifecycle state.

.Optional step:
[TIP]
====

Simulate the username import once again:

. Run the simulated _reconciliation_ task on AD resource using _Production_ configuration.
. Then have a look at the simulation results in midPoint GUI (interactively).

Inspect the changes and fix the username mapping in Active Directory if needed, before you turn import them for real.
====

Import the usernames now:

. Run the _reconciliation_ task on AD resource.
. Majority of your midPoint users should be renamed according to their Active Directory usernames.
. Users without accounts in Active Directory (e.g. still uncorrelated) will keep their original usernames from HR (based on e.g. employee number). Such users (without Active Directory accounts) can be easily found in midPoint using GUI.

=== Clean Up The Accounts

After the majority of the accounts have been correlated and usernames imported, we can handle the orphaned accounts (in situation `Unmatched`).
You have already marked your accounts (and intentionally not marked some of them).

.Please refer to the following documentation:

* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/#synchronization[Resource wizard - part Synchronization]

You can see this step in action in the First Steps Methodology webinar video:

video::suo775ym_PE[youtube,title="Step 6.1: Clean Up Orphaned Accounts",start="2723"]


You are ready for clean up procedure:

. re-configure synchronization action for `Unmatched` situation: set it to `Active` lifecycle state.
. run _reconciliation_ task with Active Directory with _Production_ configuration to see what would happen one last time. If the simulation results correspond to what youâ€™ve seen earlier with _Development_ configuration, continue.
. run _reconciliation_ task with Active Directory
. unmarked orphaned accounts should be deactivated
. additionally, the policy for orphaned accounts is set from now on, but the marked accounts will not be harmed.

During the clean up part (now or in one of the later iterations), you should check if there are any uncorrelatable accounts that can be correlated using additional correlation rules and/or operator intervention.

You can see this step in action in the First Steps Methodology webinar video:

video::suo775ym_PE[youtube,title="Step 6.2: Correlation with Operator Confirmation",start="2833"]

You should periodically review your xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/mark/[marked accounts], especially those "temporary" states such as "To be decommissioned", "Donâ€™t update" and "Correlate later".

You should also periodically run reconciliation task with your Active Directory to detect and deactivate any future orphaned accounts.
Unmarking those accounts and running _reconciliation_ task with Active Directory will remove them.

This phase may seem as pointless phase.
Why not just go directly to automation?
That is what we really want!
However, assessment is all but pointless.
Automation can be done only after the assessment phase is done.
Attempts to automate processes with unreliable data are futile, they invariably lead to failures, usually a very expensive failures.
Speaking from a couple of decades of identity management experience, there is no such thing as reliable data, unless the data are cleaned up and systematically maintained with an assistance of identity management platform.
Simply speaking: you may think that your data is good, but it is not.

=== Prepare Active Directory for Provisioning

Before turning on automation, we need to ensure the provisioning configuration for Active Directory resource is correct.
Especially if youâ€™re preparing the configuration in iterations, you need to make sure youâ€™re going right direction.
Simulations will guide you all the way.

.Please refer to the following documentation:

* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/#mappings[Resource wizard - part Mappings]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/#activation[Resource wizard - part Activation]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/#credentials[Resource wizard - part Credentials]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/#wizard-for-task-creation[Resource wizard - part Wizard for task creation]


You can see this step in action in the First Steps Methodology webinar video:

video::suo775ym_PE[youtube,title="Step 7: Enable Provisioning to Target System",start="3088"]

Prepare / update outbound attribute mappings for your Active Directory attributes that you wish to provision.
If you want to force midPoint policy for attributes, you would need to make your mappings strong (this is default if you use GUI to create the mappings).
Set your mappings' lifecycle state attributes to `Proposed` to allow simulations.

Prepare / update outbound password mapping(s) for your Active Directory:

. to generate _initial_ (strength: weak) random password for any _new_ Active Directory account from now on.
The password will be forgotten; users need to cooperate with AD administrators or Helpdesk to gain their first credentials.
. to allow passing midPoint password changes to Active Directory (if you wish to use midPoint for AD password changes).
. set your credentials mappings' lifecycle state to `Proposed` to allow simulations.

Passwords may be also changed via Active Directory as usual (or both).

Prepare / update outbound activation mapping(s) for your Active Directory:

. to enable/disable Active Directory accounts based on midPoint user's Lifecycle state
. (optional) xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/activation/#predefined-activation-mapping[configuration] for Disable instead of delete, Delayed delete etc. - if needed
. set your activation mappings(s') lifecycle state to `Proposed` to allow simulations.

NOTE: midPoint authentication against Active Directory (or LDAP) is assumed for later steps.

Then you can start your simulations:

. Run the simulated _reconciliation_ task on AD resource using _Development_ configuration.
. Then have a look at the simulation results in midPoint GUI (interactively).
. Inspect the results: if midPoint would change existing attributes, states or even passwords in Active Directory or add new values, there should be a reason for, e.g.: policy vs data inconsistency, such as:
.. Active Directory attributes are incorrect/missing, midPoint attributes based on HR data are correct.
.. Active Directory attributes are correct, midPoint attributes based on HR data are incorrect
.. mappings have errors (you need to correct them)
. Fix data vs policy inconsistency by using one or several mechanisms:
.. let midPoint to override data in Active Directory
.. fix data in HR/midPoint and reimport the user(s)
.. adjust midPoint policies (e.g. outbound attribute mappings)
.. define exceptions for specific accounts (e.g. using marks)
.. escalate the situation to let someone help (or decide)
. Repeat the process until all simulated changes make sense and can be executed for real

*When all the inconsistencies are resolved, youâ€™re prepared.*
You can turn on the provisioning:

. Set all required outbound mappings including the mappings for activation and credentials to `Active` lifecycle state
. Run the simulated _reconciliation_ task on AD resource using _Production_ configuration
. Then have a look at the simulation results in midPoint GUI (interactively) one last time.
. Run the _reconciliation_ task on AD resource

Your Active Directory resource is now configured.
Data inconsistency has been fixed.
Policy is defined, applied and will be followed from now on.
There is no automation between HR and midPoint yet, but weâ€™re already prepared for it.

.Simulation notes
[NOTE]
====
. When switching from `Proposed` to `Active` lifecycle state, use also simulation with _Production_ configuration before using the feature in real execution, if possible (usually when the real execution task is not yet running) - this is as close to the real task execution as possible.

. When switching the configuration from `Proposed` to `Active` lifecycle state, be sure to switch all relevant configuration. Otherwise, you might see different behaviour when simulating with _Development_ configuration and _Production_ configuration / real task execution.

. Try not to simulate several unrelated scenarios at the same time, otherwise switching just parts of the configuration from `Proposed` to `Active` lifecycle state may be challenging. You might see different behaviour when simulating with _Development_ configuration and _Production_ configuration / real task execution.
