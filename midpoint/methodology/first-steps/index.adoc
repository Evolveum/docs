WARNING: Work in progress

== Introduction

This is a description of simplified midPoint deployment methodology, guiding quick deployment of simple midPoint configurations.

This document is a guide to identity management deployment for small to mid-size organizations.
It describes an _iterative_ approach, providing value in small steps.

TODO: few more lines introducing the process, set expectations.

== Audience

This guide is targeted at an organization that fits following description:

* Managing hundreds to thousands of identities.

* Existing identity processes are mostly manual, possibly with some simple (home-brewed) automation (e.g. scripts or ancient identity management systems).

* There is no dedicated identity management team.
Identity management tasks are executed by general IT staff, as part of their day-to-day responsibilities.
However, there is some basic understanding of identity management concepts in IT team.

* No strict regulation compliance requirements.
Alternatively, there may be compliance requirements, yet addressing them is not immediate priority.

* There is a motivation to improve identity management, with some support from the management and reasonable budget.

* Typical organizations: mid-size enterprise, smaller government or academic institution, municipality

IT environment of the organization:

* There is a feasible source of identity data, such as human resources (HR) system.
This source has authoritative data on most of the identities.
(There is no requirement for the data to be complete or 100% exact).
There is a simple way to get the data out of the system, such as structured text export (CSV), or a database view.

* There is one "main" system that need to be managed, such as Active Directory.
Automatic management of identities in this system will provide significant benefits for the organization.
Also, there may be several such systems in the organization.

* There are some operational procedures and conventions in place, such as a convention to systematically generate a username and e-mail address.
However, there are likely exceptions, e.g. e-mail address of top management, usernames generated before the convention was in place and so on.

Which means that:

* Quality of identity data is probably low.
The HR system was maintained manually, without any automated validation of the data.
There will be typos, outdated and incomplete data.
The accounts in Active Directory (or equivalent system) were managed manually, without any regular and automated checks.
There will be accounts that belonged to employees that left several years ago.
There will be accounts still using maiden names of women that got married years ago.
There will be non-conventional usernames and account names.

* There are limited human resources that can be dedicated for identity management.
The implementation must proceed in parallel to the usual IT operation routines, requiring only a reasonable amount of effort.

* The management will want to see tangible results quite soon.
Identity management deployment cannot be executed in a "big bang" way, spending years on analysis and implementation.

* The ideal plan would be to proceed in iterations, providing value in small steps.
Each step taking several months, at most.

.No free lunch
TIP: We live in a material world.
Money are needed to do almost anything.
Identity management is no exception.
Even though midPoint is an open source _platform_ and there are no licence costs or any other costs directly associated with use of midPoint, the identity management _deployment_ is not free.
You will need money to pay your staff, pay for trainings, assistance and support.
Reasonably-sized budget is needed to get tangible results.

Please see also xref:current-situation.adoc[] for more notes on the environment and assumption for which is this guide designed.

== The Idea

TODO: Connect -> Clean-up -> Automate -> repeat

== Big Picture

TODO: intro, iterations, etc.

We propose to proceed in following steps:

. *xref:kick-off/[Kick-off]*: Start the project.
Set goals.
Identify crucial data sources and targets.
Make a plan.
Secure budget.
+
xref:kick-off/[Read more about kick-off step]

. *xref:assessment/[Assessment]*: Set up midPoint.
Load data from the source.
Compare the data with the target.
Assess data quality.
Decide next steps.
+
xref:assessment/[Read more about assessment step]

. *xref:automation/[Automation]*: Automate management of identities (to a reasonable degree).
Speed up on-boarding processes.
Make off-boarding process more reliable, improving security.
Keep data up to date.
+
xref:automation/[Read more about automation step]

These three steps start up a *program*, a never-ending process to maintain and expand the solution.
The progress of the program may be as fast or as slow as you need.
It is an endless iteration of several on-demand activities, executed as needed:

* Connect new systems.
Add more systems to your solution, much like you did in the _assessment_ step before.
This is increasing _breadth_ (scope) of your solution.

* Increase automation.
Add automated data mappings, processes and basic policies.
Your processes will run faster, more reliably, with less manual steps.
This is increasing _depth_ of your solution.

* Clean up the data.
Your data were created and maintained manually.
They often do really match exactly between systems, the data are often out of date, there are inaccuracies and errors.
Manual processes can often tolerate quite a high degree of data disorganization.
However, increased automation heavily relies on accurate data.
There is a constant need to monitor and improved data quality, correct errors, resolve inaccuracies and inconsistencies.
This is increasing _quality_ of your solution.

Apart from the three main steps, there are many optional iterations to add new systems, clean up data and increase automation.
The iterations can be repeated as many times as needed, with as big or as small scope as needed.
The overall goal of the program is to bring convergence: convergence of the data, processes and policies.

There is no pre-determined number of iterations.
The iterations should be executed as long as they bring sufficient value.
However, as the business and IT environment is ever-changing, it is very likely that at least some part of the program will become part of ordinary operational routine.

Once the first steps are complete, data are reasonably reliable, important systems are covered and processes are automated to appropriate degree, it is time to move to the next steps.
The next logical step is to focus on identity _governance_, managing entitlements, identity-related policies and business processes.

=== Iterations

TODO: describe how the add-clean-automate iterations work.

== Why MidPoint?

Why we think midPoint is the best tool for this kind of approach?

* MidPoint is open source platform.
There is a very little up-front investment.
There are no licence costs that need to be paid before project starts.

* MidPoint is completely open.
All the software is publicly available as well as all the documentation.
The very first steps (e.g. prototyping) can be done by internal staff, without a need for expensive consulting services.

* MidPoint is available immediately.
Just https://evolveum.com/download/[download it] and try it out.
No need to do any paperwork, no need to sign any contracts, no need to request access to software.
You do not even have to register, or agree to unintelligible terms of use.
Just go ahead, click the link and try it now.

* Professional support. TODO.

== What's Next

Where does it lead? -> IGA (Set up roles and policies, manage applications, entitlements, organizational structure, etc.) ... once the solution is mature enough
