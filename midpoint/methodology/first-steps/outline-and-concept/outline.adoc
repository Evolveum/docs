== Outline of this guide

To safely deploy midPoint on your actual company data, you'll go through the following steps:

. Decide what is it exactly that you need.
	** Which systems do you need to connect to identity management (IDM)?
	** What level of security do you need?
	** Consider your budget for long-term IDM expenses.
. Connect and integrate your first source and target systems using smart correlation.
. Map account attributes.
. Clean up the data by fixing inconsistencies and handling orphaned accounts.
. Automate some processes, such as the joiner-mover-leaver (JML) process.
