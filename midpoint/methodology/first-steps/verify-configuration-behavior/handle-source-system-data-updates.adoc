You have already confirmed creating new users works.
In this module, you will verify that you can actually change data in the source HRIS system and that these changes are picked up midPoint correctly.

== What awaits you this module

This exercise is short.
You will update an attribute or two of a user, wait for the recurring reconciliation task, and see what happens across the systems.

== Update user in HRIS

. Open the HRIS web interface and log in.
    ** If you are using the Docker images prepared for this guide, it is accessible under link:http://localhost/hr/wicket/bookmarkable/com.evolveum.demo.showUsers.ShowUsers[http://localhost/hr].
. Pick whichever user you like, e.g., _Geena Green_.
    ** You may need to click *Show users* at the top bar if you do not see user list.
. Click btn:[Modify] in right-most column of the listing table.
. In the form that appears, rewrite *Locality* to _Hot Lava City_.
. Click btn:[Modify user].
. Click btn:[Export users to csv file] at the bottom of the user listing page.

Now, wait for the reconciliation task to pick up the change.

To verify the change has propagated to midPoint:

. In [.nowrap]#icon:user[] *Users*# > [.nowrap]#icon:user[] *Persons*#, click _geena_ user to open Geena Green's profile.
. In select [.nowrap]#icon:history[] *History*# in Geena's profile on the left. +
+
.You can see here that the user has been modified through the reconciliation xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/channel/[channel].

. Click the time stamp to open the audit log entry with details of what has changed.

.On the right, you can see that both the focus and the LDAP account of Geena have been modified.

This clearly shows your setup works as expected.
