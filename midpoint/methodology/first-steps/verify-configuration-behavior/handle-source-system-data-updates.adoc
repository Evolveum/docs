You have already confirmed creating new users works.
In this module, you will verify that you can actually change data in the source HRIS system and that these changes are picked up midPoint correctly.

== What awaits you this module

This exercise is short:

. Update an attribute of a user.
. Wait for the recurring reconciliation task to run.
. Inspect midPoint configuration results across the systems.

== Update user in HRIS

. Open the HRIS web interface and log in.
    ** If you are using the Docker images prepared for this guide, it is accessible under link:http://localhost/hr/wicket/bookmarkable/com.evolveum.demo.showUsers.ShowUsers[http://localhost/hr].
. Pick whichever user you like, e.g., _Geena Green_.
    ** You may need to click *Show users* at the top bar if you do not see user list.
. Click btn:[Modify] in right-most column of the listing table.
. In the form that appears, rewrite *Locality* to _Hot Lava City_.
. Click btn:[Modify user].
. Click btn:[Export users to csv file] at the bottom of the user listing page.

== Let automation handle the updates

Now, wait for the xref:/midpoint/methodology/first-steps/automate-target-system-integration/generate-usernames-in-midpoint/#automate-importing-users-to-midpoint[recurring HRIS reconciliation task] you have already up and running task to pick up the changes.

== Inspect the results

To verify the change has propagated to midPoint:

. In [.nowrap]#icon:user[] *Users*# > [.nowrap]#icon:user[] *Persons*#, click _geena_ user to open Geena Green's profile.
. In select [.nowrap]#icon:history[] *History*# in Geena's profile on the left. +
+
.You can see here that the user has been modified through the reconciliation xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/channel/[channel].
image::midpoint-geena-user-history-modified-by-reconciliation.webp[]

. Click the time stamp to open the audit log entry with details of what has changed.
+
.On the right, you can see that both the focus and the LDAP account of Geena have been modified.
image::midpoint-geena-user-audit-log.webp[]

. You can check the data on the target LDAP system by two means:
    ** In the user profile > [.nowrap]#icon:male[] *Projections*#, select the target resource, and look at the attribute values.
    ** Go directly to the target system interface and confirm the changes there.

This experiment clearly shows your setup works as expected.
The changes you have made in the source system propagate to midPoint and then to the target system.

== Next steps

Having successfully covered two out of the three basic IGA transitions (*join*, *move,* leave), you have yet left to confirm your configuration performs correctly for *leavers.*
In the next module, you will do exactly that.
