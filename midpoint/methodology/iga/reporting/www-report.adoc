= Report: Who Has Access to What and Why
:page-nav-title: Report: Who has access to what and why
:page-display-order: 100

This is main IGA report. It is assignment report displaying data in business terminology. For specified set of users, it reports *their actual assignments* of business and application roles and their membership in organizational structure.

Assignment of an application role represents access of the user to an application. Assignment of the business role may represent user's working position.
Assignment of an organizational unit represents user's position in the organization or in a project.

== Reason

Literally this report display information exactly according its name:

* *Who* - identification of the user
* *has access* - the assignment. It is the line in the report.
* *where* - role name and application. Application defines target where the user has access, role name explain level of access in business terminology.
* and *why* - policy, request, assigned business role or membership in organization unit why the user has the assignment

The report is designed to provide means for:

* analyzing user access for the defined scope of users
* compare assignments among set of users and identify business patterns of access
* identify unnecessary access
* analyze access for scope of users

Providing such information in the form of report enables export of the data for further analysis outside midPoint.

== Audience

Role manager, Security officers, but also business managers for some business needs e.g. analyzing access of all his subordinates.

== Scope of users

The report should be run on limited set of users only.

Primary reason is *business* - it mostly makes sense to compare access within limited scope of users - within people in organizational unit or comparing similar working positions in different units.

Secondary - building such report is quite *resource intensive*. Listing direct or indirect assignments is not an issue. But displaying "WHY" is. Showing that user has role X assigned, because this role is included in the business roles A and B requires detail analysis of all his assignments and can't be performed just by reading the database data.

Additionally - the amount of data may be *quite large*. Multiplying thousands of users with up to a hundred of assignments may provide quite large sets of data for easy business analysis.

And the last reason is *security*. As any with any other report - exporting information outside the midPoint increases risk of unauthorized access to the information. And the more information is exported, the worse may be the impact of unauthorized access.

== Report details

The report should provide information as seen on the picture:

For specified list of users the report should provide:
