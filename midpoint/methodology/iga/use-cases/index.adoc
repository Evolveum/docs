WARNING: This page is a work in progress.

Business use cases and "user stories" for Identity Governance and Administration. The purpose of this document is to guide design activities by providing a list all the practical use cases for inspiration. We do not claim that our implementation will support all of those use cases.

This list is not complete. It is expected that it will be continually updated.

== Actors

IGA information is consumed by different actors. Starting with end-users, through technical engineers and finishing by business and security managers.

The IGA information must be available to all of them in the form they need.

| Actor
| Form of information
| Information
| Interface

| End user
| Business level
| Typical interaction of end user is self-service - end user needs to request new access, modify his profile and review the access he has assigned already. He needs to see information of individuals - himself or his teammates.

End-user needs the access described in business form.
| Self-service GUI

| Power user
| Business level
| This is typically business manager or any person who is responsible for managing access of others. Additionally, to the operation of typical end-user, he needs to approve access requests, manage his teams and their access and create/modify business roles.

Typically, he needs to obtain the information by viewing object details in business form and some specific reports prepared for their teams.
| Self-service GUI

| Application engineer
| Business level + technical level (only in definition of his roles)
| Application engineer is end-user in IGA solution with specific privileges. Within role engineering process he creates and manages details of application roles related to his application.

He needs to see these roles, view also technical content of the roles (not XML, just via GUI) and be able to approve requests if he is assigned as an approver of any role.
| Administration GUI (only for role engineering)

| IGA operator
| Business level + technical level
| This is typically helpdesk operator or some IT operator. The person should be able to manage user attributes (e.g.credentials), manage access for the (scope of) users and manage the teams. He needs to process operation over bulk of users.

He needs to operate via GUI.
| Administrator GUI

| IGA administrator / +
IGA engineer
| Both business and technical level + full access to XML details of the objects.
| These users need full access to the system using GUI and other tools. Need to configure IGA system and also data (on request)
| Administrator GUI +
Other tools

| Role manager
| Both business and technical level
| Needs full access to the GUI, to be able to fully view and possibly manage the role data (structure and assignments).
| Administrator GUI

| Security officer / Auditor
| Both business and technical level
| Needs full read access to GUI. Typically, these actors need to see/run reports and user details of specific users.
| Administrator GUI
|===

The meaning of the form of information is as follows:

* Business level - providing information in the form of "user", his "attributes", "application", "role", "access".
* Technical level - technical information of user's "accounts", "entitlements" (assigned objects). Configuration of application role (inducements, archetypes, ...) but displayed in GUI and terminology acceptable to IT users not specified in midPoint.
* XML details - detail deep midPoint configuration. Good midPoint knowledge is needed.

== Use-Cases

Multiple use-cases may be defined for the Identity governance.
Use-cases in following areas are described:

* *Role engineering and governance* - specific use-cases related to management of roles
* *Operations / data governance* - management of user assignments
* *Self-service* - IGA operations performed by end-users - mostly assignment of an access
* *Access certification* - Business review of user access
* *Visibility and reports* - providing useful IGA information from data.

Additional use-cases listed below were considered in this area. They relate to role engineering process or some other events. They will be part of FUTURE works.

. Modify business attributes of application role
. Modify provisioning configuration of application role (When provisioning configuration is updated, then recompute of the role members is needed.)
. Modify content of business role
. Decommission role
. Decommission application
. Define approval policy (UI updates)
. Define auto-assignment rule for specified role (UI updates)
. Update/remove role auto-assignment (UI updates)

Additional use-cases listed below were considered in this area.They will be part of FUTURE works.

. Bypass role engineering process - this will be in plan when the role engineering process will be implemented.
. Bypass access request process - possible already
. Recompute the role assignments
. Troubleshoot the recompute operation
. Approve/Reject request on behalf - already implemented in some way


=== Self-service

In this section we described only self-service use cases that relates mostly to access visibility and access management.

=== Access Certifications

|Priority| Use-case name | Note
| P4 | xref:access-cert-uc.adoc#_all_user_assignments_should_be_displayed_in_certification[All user assignments should be displayed in certification.] | Also in business terminology - "access to application".
|===


=== Visibility and reports

The IGA system should provide useful IGA information from the data. In the form that is readable by the users - in the "language" they speak and can easily understand.

We can expect that the users such as helpdesk operators, auditors, security officers, or application engineers that use midPoint roles for managing access to their applications may have knowledge about identity management, provisioning, roles or technology infrastructure, but specific midpoint terminology may confuse them.
