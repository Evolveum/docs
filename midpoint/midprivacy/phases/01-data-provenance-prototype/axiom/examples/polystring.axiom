      Polymorphic string.
      String that may have more than one representation at
      the same time. The primary representation is the original version that is
      composed of the full Unicode character set. The other versions may be
      normalized to trim it, normalize character case, normalize spaces,
      remove national characters or even transliterate the string.

      There is an alternative syntactic short-cut representation of PolyString. If no
      child element is present then the text entire text content of this element is
      considered as if it was present in the 'orig' element. That's the reason for making
      this type 'mixed'.

      This is considered to be primitive built-in type for prism objects.
