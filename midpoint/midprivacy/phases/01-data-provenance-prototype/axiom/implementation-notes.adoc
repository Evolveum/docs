== Namespace Resolution

Models are identified by using namespace.
That's what import statement specifies.
We need to get from the namespece (URI) to file that contains model definition.
There are two options:

* *Offline: catalog*: Use catalog file that maps namespace URIs to filenames.

* *Online: web resolution*: Use HTTP get on namespace to get model spec.
This needs to be a bit more complex as we need to specify model verion (or version range).
