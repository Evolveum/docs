= Axiom Metadata

== Example: MidPoint Metadata

Option 1: `metadata` keyword:

[source]
----
model midpoint {
    metadata StorageMetadata {  // Creates type StorageMetadata
        target {
            // apply this metadata for all Prism items
            itemType prism:Item;
        }
        itemName: storage;
        item creation { ... }
        item modification { ... }
    }
}
----

Option 2: Augmentation

Not a good option. Metadata may be too complex to be handled by simple augmentation.
This is also not very readable.

[source]
----
model midpoint {
    augmentation ValueMetadata {
        target axiom:ValueMetadata;  // Magic type
        item storage {
            type StorageMetadata;
        }
    }

    type StorageMetadata {
        item creation { ... }
        item modification { ... }
    }
}
----

Metadata serialized with data:

[source,xml]
----
    ...
    <description>
        <axiom:value>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ...</axiom:value>
        <midpoint:storage>
            <midpoint:creation>...</midpoint:creation>
            <midpoint:modification>...</midpoint:modification>
        </midpoint:storage>
    </description>
    ...
----


[source,json]
----
  ...
  "description" : {
    "@value" : "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ...",
    "http://.../midpoint#storage" : {
      "creation" : ....,
      "modification" : ....
    }
  }
----


== Completeness

TODO

Use case: jpegPhoto was not fetched from repository and we do not know whether it has a value or not.

[source,xml]
----
    ...
    <jpegPhoto xsi:nil="true">
        <axiom:completeness>incomplete</axiom:completeness>
    </jpegPhoto>
    ...
----

There is an issue that the completeness is a property of `jpegPhoto` item, not a particular value.
But we cannot express data about an item if there is no value present.
Hence the `nil`.
The `nil` indicates that this value is not really a value.

[source,json]
----
  ...
  "jpegPhoto" : {
    "@value" : null,
    "@completeness" : "incomplete"
  }
----

The `@value=null` may be optional, as this is a hash and no value is specified this should be obvious.

Use case: password is present, but we cannot or do not want to disclose the value.
However, we want to indicate that there is a password.

[source,xml]
----
    ...
    <password xsi:nil="true">
        <axiom:significance>unknown</axiom:significance>
    </password>
    ...
----

[source,json]
----
  ...
  "password" : {
    "@significance" : "unknown"
  }
----


== Prism Expressions

[source]
----
model prism {
    metadata ValueExpression {
        target {
            itemType prism:Property;
        }
        itemName: expression;
        type: Expression;
    }
}
----

Example data with expression.
`prop123` is a string prism property.

[source,xml]
----
    ...
    <prop123>
        <axiom:significance>unknown</axiom:significance>
        <prism:expression>
            <midpoint:const>const123</midpoint:const>
        </prism:expression>
    </prop123>
    ...
----

[source,json]
----
  ...
  "prop123" : {
    "@expression" : {
      "const" : "const123"
    }
  }
  ...
----

Question: Expression is a prism concept, but we would like to use short-hand `@expression` instead of long QName.
How to do this?

Question: Do we need to set `@significance=unknown` here explicitly?
Or can we infer that from the fact that there is no `@value` here?
We could perhaps do that in JSON.
But XML will still need either explicit significance or `xsi:nil`, because all XMl elements have value (even if it is empty string).
Or can be have XML parsing mode where we ignore whitespace in indent and consider empty string to be null?

== Metadata Of Negative Values

Metadata serialized with data:

[source,xml]
----
    ...
    <description>
        <axiom:value>This was all wrong, it is gone now</axiom:value>
        <axiom:significance>negative</axiom:significance>
        <midpoint:transformation>
            <midpoint:mapping>...</midpoint:mapping>
        </midpoint:storage>
    </description>
    ...
----


[source,json]
----
  ...
  "description" : {
    "@value" : "This was all wrong, it is gone now",
    "@significance" : "negative",
    "http://.../midpoint#transformation" : {
      "mapping" : ....,
    }
  }
----
