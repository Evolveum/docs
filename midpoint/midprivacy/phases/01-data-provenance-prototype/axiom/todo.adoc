= Axiom TODO

Those are specification and conceptual things to figure out.

Coding/development tasks are *not* here. Use Jira for that.

== High Prio

Need to do in M2.

* Finish Axiom spec document:

** Items, values and types: Tony

** Primitive types: Tony

*** Final list of primitive data types (`axiom-types.axiom`): Tony

*** Short explanation of simple type subtyping.

*** Primitive types: without prefix

*** Qualified name datatype, rules for namespace lookup

** Syntax description review: Rado

** Versioning: Rado

** Advanced concepts (e.g. inframodel intro): Rado

** Item path: Rado

*** Namespaces in item path: prefixes and full URIs

** Augmentation and data:

** How to implement dynamic model: shadow attributes, resource connector configuration: "dynamic" data type, decided, need to be documented

*** what is the "cannonical" representation: <axiom:foo>: Rado

*** path: how do we address extension data: axiom:foo: Rado

* Complete `axiom-model.axiom` and other Axiom defs (for M2): Tony

* Use of metadata in mappings: Palo

* Metadata usage survey: Slavek

* "Metadata for dummies": document explaining metadata, how they will work in midPoint, how they will be expressed in Axiom -
   and why we needed to create Axiom to support metadata.
Where are we now.
Can be referenced from blog, can be used in report to NGI. : Rado


== Mid Prio

Can wait for M3, but we need that in midPoint 4.2.

* Are primitive types (e.g. string) extendable? Can we inhering from them? Can we augment them? How will this work? : Tony

* Enumerations

* Heterolists: How to define them? How would they work? Make the ordered? How to make them pluggable?

** Use of heterolists for expression evaluators

* How will we support expressions in filter? How would we use query language at all? Or will query be special?

* Check that Axiom is web-friendly.

* Smooth out JSON/YAML syntax: e.g. @ns or @context?

* minOccurs/maxOccurs or required/multivalue?

* Final `axiom-*.axiom`: Tony

* Axiom and Prism (and midPoint):

** MidPoint resource schema and shadow attributes: will they fit? How do we deal with namespaces here?

** Draft of `prism.axiom`

** Concept of "container key" and item path.

** Decide about deltas: "native" data structures in Axiom? Or Prism?

** Decide about query language: part of prism or axiom?

** Prism/midpoint: object reference and relation

** Display properties (e.g. displayName)

** How would midPoint associate lookup table with item definition? (e.g. locales)

* Documentation

** Operational items

** Elaborate items

== Low Prio

Can wait for midPoint 4.3.

* Annotations: how would we support custom annotations in model?

* Make Prism web-friendly (e.g. translate OIDs to URIs)

* Transform midpoint schemas to Axiom.
