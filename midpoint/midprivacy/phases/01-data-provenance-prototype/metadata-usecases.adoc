= Metadata Usecases and Structure Design

Those are the notes about the expected use of meta-data in midPoint.

* Provenance Data

** _storage metadata_ (needs better name): the details when data were stored in midPoint repository. See `MetadataType` in common-3 schema.

*** create timestamp, orginator user, channel, taskRef

*** last modification timestamp, orginator user, channel, taskRef

** _process metadata_ (needs better name): the details how the data were processed by midPoint processes/tasks. Only present if it was approved or otherwise processed by a "process". See `MetadataType` in common-3 schema.

*** request timestamp, originator user, comment, channel

*** last change (create, modify) timestamp, approver, comment

*** last certification timestamp, outcome, certifier, comment

** provisioning metadata

*** last provisioning timestamp

** Transformation/processing metadata

*** data sources

*** mappings that processed the data
