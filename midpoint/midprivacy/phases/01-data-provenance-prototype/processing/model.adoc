= Metadata processing model

This is a description how metadata in midPoints are processed. The focus is on processing metadata using _mappings_.

== Data processing model

Before trying to describe metadata processing, let us start with something simpler: How midPoint processes ordinary data?

There are three basic conceptual levels of processing, shown here from bottom-up:

1. link:plain/expressions/[Expressions]
2. Mappings
3. Mapping sets

== Metadata processing model

When thinking about metadata processing, we - again - have to think at various levels.

1. Expressions
2. Mappings
3. Mapping sets
