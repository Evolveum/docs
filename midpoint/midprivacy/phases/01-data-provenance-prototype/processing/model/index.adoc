= Metadata processing model

This is a description how metadata in midPoints are processed. The focus is on processing metadata using _mappings_.

== Data processing model

Before trying to describe metadata processing, let us start with something simpler: How midPoint processes ordinary data?

There are three basic conceptual levels of processing, shown here from bottom-up:

1. link:plain/expressions/[Expressions]
2. link:plain/mappings/[Mappings]
3. link:plain/mapping-sets/[Mapping sets]

== Metadata processing model

Before thinking about metadata processing let us explore some link:examples/[Examples].

Here are some unorganized link:thoughts/[thoughts] about metadata processing.
