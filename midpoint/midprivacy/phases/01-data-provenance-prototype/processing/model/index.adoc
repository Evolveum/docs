= Metadata processing model

This is a description how metadata in midPoints are processed.

Please read link:notation/[Notation] and link:comparing-values/[Comparing values] first.

Because all processing in midPoint is based on relative changes, the following documents provide the necessary background:

* link:change-representation/[Change representation (no metadata)]
* link:change-representation-with-metadata/[Change representation (with metadata)]

The processing is described at several layers:

1. link:plain/expressions/[Expressions]
2. TODO

== Data processing model (TODO)

* link:plain/mappings/[Mappings]
* link:plain/mapping-sets/[Mapping sets]
* some link:examples/[examples].
* some unorganized link:thoughts/[thoughts] about metadata processing and some link:open-questions/[open questions].
