= Processing metadata in expressions

See link:https://wiki.evolveum.com/display/midPoint/Expression[Expression] for background information on expression evaluation
and link:../../plain/expressions/[Processing expressions] for information on processing "simple" data expressions.

To recall, an _expression evaluator_ converts _sources_ and _input variables_ to _output values_ (under given evaluation parameters).

Each value being processed can have its own _value metadata_ and, therefore, we have to process this metadata
along with the data.

Metadata can be present on values from both sources and variables but for the time being we will explicitly
deal with metadata from sources only.

Some examples:
