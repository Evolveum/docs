= Open questions related to metadata processing

== Data derived implicitly i.e. not in context of a mapping

An example is deriving `roleMembershipRef` value from an assignment. We should have some rules (e.g. what to propagate and how)
for this case.

== Metadata value consolidation (conflicting values)

What if we are merging two equal values (e.g. for `roleMembershipRef`) carrying different metadata?

== Metadata value consolidation (conflicting mappings)

What if different mappings provide different values for single metadata item for a given data value?
(We could perhaps apply existing data consolidation practices here.)
