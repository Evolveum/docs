= Processing mapping sets

See link:https://wiki.evolveum.com/display/midPoint/Mapping[Mapping] for background information.

Evaluation of _mapping sets_ converts _source object_ into a set of _item deltas_ to be applied on this object.
It consists of evaluation of the mappings (probably chained because of mutual dependencies) and of _consolidation_
of mappings output triples into item deltas.

Compared with link:../mappings/[single mapping evaluation] it provides the conversion of output triples into item deltas,
applying settings for individual mappings, namely the strength (normal, strong, weak).
