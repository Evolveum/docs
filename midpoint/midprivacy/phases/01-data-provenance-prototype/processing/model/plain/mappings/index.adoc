= Processing mappings

See link:https://wiki.evolveum.com/display/midPoint/Mapping[Mapping] for background information.

A mapping maps  _source items_ to _target item_ using an _expression evaluator_.

Compared with plain link:../expressions/[expression evaluators] it brings the following features:

1. binding expression sources and output to object items - including features like domain and range specification,
2. condition evaluation modifying the output triple set,
3. time applicability.
