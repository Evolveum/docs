= How to attach metadata mappings to data mappings?

It would be awkward to specify metadata mappings for every data mapping where they should be applied.

Many of the metadata mappings have global applicability. For example, we want to propagate level of assurance
or confidentiality level across mappings without an explicit notion. Or we want to provide value origin
(source/transformation) mapping to values of all or selected items.
