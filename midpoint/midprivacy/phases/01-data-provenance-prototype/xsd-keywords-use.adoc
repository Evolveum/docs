## List of elements used in midPoint / Prism schemas

### Core XSD Elements

.XSD concepts used in midPoint
|===
| Element | Type / Use in Midpoint | Description
| xsd:annotation | syntactic (overhead) | Holder for xsd:documentation or xsd:appinfo
| xsd:any | model | allows any elements (used for extensions / custom structured data)
| xsd:anyAttribute | model | allows any attributes
| xsd:appinfo | syntactic (overhead) | Holder for application specific annotations
| xsd:attribute | model | Represents attributes (since addition of support for YAML / XML - midPoint mostly treats attributes as elements)
| xsd:complexContent | model | Represents complex content
| xsd:complexType | model | Represents complex type
| xsd:documentation | documentation |
| xsd:element | model | Represents element (in midPoint these can be objects, properties or containers)
| xsd:enumeration | model | Enumarate possible value
| xsd:extension | model | Extends possible value set
| xsd:choice | model | allows only one of the elements contained in the <choice> declaration to be present within the containing element.
| xsd:import | model | Imports schema
| xsd:include | model | Includes schema
| xsd:minInclusive | model |
| xsd:restriction | model | Restricts possible value set
| xsd:sequence | syntactic (overhead) | Represents sequence of elements, but midPoint is order-agnostic so this is overhead.
| xsd:schema | model | Definition of schema document
| xsd:simpleContent | model | Represents simple content (may be used in complexType when type contains attributes)
| xsd:simpleType | model | Represents simple type

### midPoint/Prism XSD Annotations

.Prism modeling annotations
|===
| Element | Type / Use in Midpoint | Description

| a:container | model | complex types that are considered prism containers.
| a:object | model | This annotation marks complex types that are considered prism objects.
| a:type | model | Type override annotation
| a:composite | model | Marks composite reference. Composite references do not refer to the target object by OID but rather contain the entire target object forming a composition.
| a:operational | model | Marks operational property. Operational properties are auxiliary data (or meta-data) that are usually not modifiable by the end user. They are generated and maintained by the system.
| a:experimental | model | Marks experimental functionality.
| a:maxOccurs | model | maxOccurs XSD attribute, but can also be used with top-level elements.
| a:oid |model | Target of the reference.
| a:type | model | Type of the reference target object.
| a:extension | model | Complex type annotation. Complex type that contains this annotation defines the content of the 'extension' item of data type specified by the content of this annotation.
| a:objectReference | model | object reference. This annotation specifies that an element or data type is object reference (PrismReference).
| a:objectReferenceTargetType | model | Object reference annotation: reference target type. Content of this annotation specifies the object type that the reference points to.
| a:elaborate | model | Marks elaborate items. Elaborate items are complicated data structure that may deviate from normal principles of the system.
| a:valueEnumerationRef | model | Reference to an object that directly or indirectly represents possible values for
| a:matchingRule | model | Matching rules are algorithms that specify how to compare, normalize and/or order the values.
|===

.midPoint Model Lifecycle Annotations
|===
| Element | Type / Use in Midpoint | Description

| a:deprecated | schema lifecycle | Marks deprecated parts of the schema.
| a:since | schema lifecycle | Version of data model in which was the item introduced.
| a:deprecatedSince | schema lifecycle | Version of data model in which was the item marked as deprecated.
| a:plannedRemoval | schema lifecycle | Version of data model in which the item is likely to be removed.
| a:plannedChange | schema lifecycle | Version of data model in which the item is likely to be changed in a non-compatible way.
| a:schemaMigration | schema lifecycle | Annotation that describes schema changes that need to be migrated.
|===

.midPoint User Interface Annotations
|===
| Element | Type / Use in Midpoint | Description

| a:displayName | user inteface | item display name. The content of this annotation specifies a human-readable string that describes the type.
| a:displayOrder | user inteface | display order
| a:help | user inteface | help text. The help text is usually displayed as a tooltip or when a special icon is clicked.
| a:processing | user inteface | Specifies the "depth" of item processing. In midPoint 3.8 this is only supported by the user interface (presentation layer) and only as an experimental feature.
| a:emphasized | user inteface | Set true for definitions that are more important than others and that should be emphasized during presentation.
| a:label | user inteface | Displayable label of enumeration item.
| a:access | security | access restrictions. This annotation specifies the allowed operations for an item.
|===

.midPoint Data Store Annotations
|===
| Element | Type / Use in Midpoint | Description

| a:indexed | storage | indexed property. Property that has this annotation should be indexed in the data store.
| a:indexOnly | storage | index-only property. Property that has this annotation should be indexed in the data store but not stored in "full" object representation.
| a:index | storage | Specifies type of index that is maintained for this item. The data store maintains this type of index for the item.
| a:relational | storage| Marks a container that contains relational data. The relational container provides data that are normally stored in a simple relational table.
| a:expensive | system | Marks an expensive item. Expensive items are not returned from some operations by default. They have to be explicitly requested.
|===

.Prism Data Processing Annotations
|===
| Element | Type / Use in Midpoint | Description

| a:ignore | processing | Item marker annotation: ignored item. Item that has this annotation should be ignored by any processing.
| a:defaultNamespace | processing | When resolving unqualified elements, what should be the default namespace to look into at first.
| a:ignoredNamespace | processing | When resolving unqualified elements, what namespace(s) should be ignored.
| a:heterogeneousListItem | processing | This substitutable element can be used in "heterogeneous list" items, i.e. items that can have several values with different types.
| a:instantiationOrder | processing | When parsing a field that is known to contain an abstract data type (e.g. LocalizableMessageType) and has no xsi:type, one has to guess which subtype to instantiate.
