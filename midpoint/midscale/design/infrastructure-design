= Infrastructure Design Meeting

== Overview

The goal of _design meeting_ is to figure out design details about particular functionality of a software, particular solution, or even a methodology or process.
It is usualy applied to midPoint design.
But it may be also useful for non-technical and organizational aspects.

Design meeting is a creative, free-form discussion.
It may be following an agenda, but it is usually closer to a free-form brainstorming.

== Schedule

Design meetings are schedules as needed, the schedule is not fixed.
For midPoint, the design meeting usually happens at the beginning of a development cycle or milestone cycle.

== What To Discuss

=== Motivation and Requirements

What is the *motivation* to discuss this topic at all?
Do customers need it?
What are the *use cases*?
Will it help make deployments better/faster?
How exactly?

What will happen if we just do nothing?
Do we really need this?
It is worth the effort?

Should we do this now?
Maybe we can postpone it, there may be better opportunity in the future.

What are the *assumptions*?
What we expect that customers will do?
Maybe we are not certain about some requirements and we just assume something?

Do we have some *performance* or *scalability* targets?
Do we know how big a system do we want to support?
How many users, how many requests per second, special usage patterns (bursts), anything else?

=== Ideas and Concepts

When thinking about the use cases, do not limit your thoughts to just that one specific use case.
Think about generic mechanisms, broader principles.
Focus on *concepts* and ideas, rather than algorithms.
Design mechanism that can handle your use case, and thousands of similar use cases as well.
Design *generic re-usable mechanisms*.

Make sure the new mechanisms work well with existing mechanisms.
We are looking for *synergies*.
We want to combine mechanisms together into more flexible and more powerful solutions.

=== Implementation

TODO: feasibility

=== Performance and Scalability Considerations

TODO

=== Testability Considerations

Make sure that the functionality can be tested.
Think about the testing process.
Can this be teste by the ususal mechanisms that we have?
Will we need some special environment or setup?

=== Security Considerations

TODO

=== Rolling Wave Design

TODO

== Write It Down

Notes from design meeting at the appropriate place.
For midPoint, the appropriate place is usually https://docs.evolveum.com/midpoint/devel/design/[Design Notes at docs] for public notes, or https://guide.priv.evolveum.com/midpoint/notes/[MidPoint Design Notes at guide] for private notes.

Do not forget to document:

* *Requirements* and *assumptions*. Interesting *use cases*.

* Outline of the *approach*, important aspects of algorithms, schemas and so on.

* *Decisions* that were made, also the explanation or *motivation* _why_ the decision was made.

* Outline of a *plan*.
What do we implement now?
What parts will remain to be implemented later?

* *Risks* and challenges.
What parts are likely to be problematic?
Where can the design fail?

* *Open questions*.
What we cannot answer now?
What problems remain to be solved later?
