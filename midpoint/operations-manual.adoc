== Common Errors

When midPoint is not working as expected (or not at all), usually there will be an indication of problem displayed in the `midpoint.log` file which is located in midPoint "Home directory".

[TIP]
====
MidPoint "Home directory", commonly referred as `midpoint.home` or `$midpoint.home` is by default the `var/` subdirectory of the directory where midPoint is installed and running from.

When midPoint is started, it is used as a JVM option `-Dmidpoint.home=/opt/midpoint/var` for the midPoint process, e.g.:

[source,bash,subs=+quotes]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *ps -ef | grep midpoint*
midpoint  2612     1 99 09:42 ?        00:00:04 /usr/bin/java -Xmx4096m *-Dmidpoint.home=/opt/midpoint/var* -jar /opt/midpoint/lib/midpoint.war
----

In the previous example, midPoint "Home directory" (`midpoint.home`) is `/opt/midpoint/var`.

====

Although it may be tempting to simply restart midPoint if it misbehaves, we encourage you to check the `midpoint.log` file for any anomalies, exceptions and errors first.
Without proper diagnostic, restarting midPoint will not help to actually prevent the problem from occurring again.

The most common errors, the diagnostic steps to confirm them, their reasons and possible remediations are documented in this chapter.

=== midPoint GUI is displayed, but login does not work

*Symptoms:*

* midPoint is working, GUI can be displayed

* page `http[s]://<midpoint_host>/midpoint/actuator/health` is available and returns: `{"status":"UP"}`

* midPoint process is running

* after administrator login attempt, the following message is displayed: "*Currently we are unable to process your request. Kindly try again later.*"

Please check if the `midpoint.log` file contains any errors or exceptions.
Search for encryption/keystore-related errors.
For example the following error indicates that the key used to protect password of user you are trying to log in as, does not exist in the keystore:

.midpoint.log file:
[source]
----
2022-02-16 16:40:57,292 [] [http-nio-8080-exec-9] ERROR (com.evolveum.midpoint.model.impl.security.AuthenticationEvaluatorImpl): Error dealing with credentials of user "administrator" credentials: No key mapped to key digest /IRZpSn3WpsebAEhhmk8PoMQnJo= could be found in the keystore. Keys digests must be recomputed during initialization
----

Please check if you can log in with the same user using different midPoint node.
If yes, the problem is local to the specific node and is probably caused by keystore problem on that specific node.

Open midPoint's `config.xml` file and check which key is configured in the following part of the configuration:

.config.xml file fragment:
[source,xml,highlight='5']
----
. . .
       <keystore>
            <keyStorePath>${midpoint.home}/keystore.jceks</keyStorePath>
            <keyStorePassword>changeit</keyStorePassword>
            <encryptionKeyAlias>default</encryptionKeyAlias> <!--1-->
       </keystore>
. . .
----
<1> the name of the encryption key is `default`

Check if the key used as default encryption key by midPoint is stored in `keystore.jceks` in midPoint.home directory by running `keytool` command.
The error below indicates the references key (`default`) does not exist in midPoint's `keystore.jceks` file.

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *keytool -keystore /opt/midpoint/var/keystore.jceks -storetype jceks -storepass changeit -list -alias default*

keytool error: java.lang.Exception: Alias <default> does not exist
----

If you are using any certificates for secure connection to the target systems, you can also check if you can see the certificates in the `keystore.jceks` file.
If the file has been replaced by a newly generated one, no target system certificates will be in the keystore, and only one key named "default" will be present.
Also, the `keystore.jceks` file creation timestamp may help.

If you have midPoint cluster, you can compare the `keystore.jceks` files between all nodes - they should be kept the same anyway.
As a solution, as you may use `keystore.jceks` from working midPoint node.

*Reason*:

* you have removed `keystore.jceks` file (midPoint creates a new one upon restart, with completely different default encryption key), which breaks the authentication of users using the password encrypted by the missing key

* you have removed encryption key which is in use (e.g. `default`) as stated by `keytool` error message (see above), which breaks the authentication of users using the password encrypted by the missing key

*Resolution*:

. fix `keystore.jceks` file by restoring it from backup or another midPoint node (if you are using cluster and login works in another midPoint node)
. restart midPoint using the steps from <<running_monitoring_and_alerting>> chapter
. check if midPoint is running and working correctly including login


=== midPoint GUI is not accessible at all, because the process is not started at all

*Symptoms:*

* midPoint is not working (GUI cannot be displayed)

* page `http[s]://<midpoint_host>/midpoint/actuator/health` is not available

* midPoint process is not running

*Reason*:

* you have not started midPoint yet, or the startup script is missing

*Resolution:*

* use the steps from <<running_monitoring_and_alerting>> chapter to check if midPoint runs and start it if necessary.


=== midPoint is not starting because config.xml is unreadable

*Symptoms*:

* midPoint is not working (GUI cannot be displayed)

* page `http[s]://<midpoint_host>/midpoint/actuator/health` is not available

* midPoint process is not running

* `midpoint.log` contains the error during startup after this message:

=== midPoint is not starting because the `midpoint.home` directory has no write permissions

*Symptoms*:

* midPoint is not working (GUI cannot be displayed)

* page `http[s]://<midpoint_host>/midpoint/actuator/health` is not available

* midPoint process is not running

* `midpoint.log` does not exist because `midpoint.home` directory does not exist

* system log (e.g. `/var/log/syslog` or `journalctl`) contains the following errors:
`feb 17 10:54:44 mid-101 java[3759]: ERROR in ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender[MIDPOINT_LOG] - Failed to create parent directories for [/opt/midpoint/var/log/midpoint.log`

*Reason*:

* you misconfigured your `midpoint.home` JVM property: it points to non-writable or non-existent directory (If the `config.xml` cannot be found, midPoint tries to create a default one without database configuration, along with the parent directory. The directory must be writable for user executing the midPoint process)
* you misconfigured the permissions for `midpoint.home` directory or its parent

*Resolution*:

. fix `midpoint.home` JVM property value and/or the directory permissions/ownership

. restart midPoint using the steps from <<running_monitoring_and_alerting>> chapter

. check if midPoint is running and working correctly

----

*Reason*:

* midPoint repository configuration has changed (IP, port etc.)

* there is a firewall blocking connection to midPoint repository

* midPoint repository is not online or the database is damaged

*Resolution*:

. test the communication between midPoint server and its database repository
. fix `config.xml` file if the database repository location or configuration has been changed
. fix the database problem and/or networking issues such as firewall if the database repository configuration was not changed
. restart midPoint using the steps from <<running_monitoring_and_alerting>> chapter after the issue is resolved
. check if midPoint is running and working correctly

[NOTE]
====
Shutting down midPoint when the database connection is timing out might take more time as usual.

=== midPoint GUI stopped working during operation because there is not enough memory to complete the operation

*Symptoms*:

* midPoint is not working (GUI appears to be frozen)

* page `http[s]://<midpoint_host>/midpoint/actuator/health` is available and returns: `{"status":"UP"}`

* midPoint process is running

* `midpoint.log` contains the error during operation: `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`

*Reason*:

* too low value for `-Xmx` JVM parameter

*Resolution*:

. set correct `-Xmx` JVM parameter value (we also recommend setting the same value for `-Xms` JVM parameter)
The recommended minimum for midPoint is 4 GB for production use.
Do not exceed the physical memory size of your machine.
. restart midPoint using the steps from <<running_monitoring_and_alerting>> chapter

*Reason:*

* there might not be free space on filesystem where log is stored

* check the free space on the filesystem hosting the `midpoint.log` file

*Resolution*:

. free some disk space on the filesystem hosting your midPoint logs

. increase size of the filesystem/disk hosting your midPoint logs

. change the logging configuration to use different filesystem for midPoint logs

. restart midPoint using the steps from <<running_monitoring_and_alerting>> chapter after the issue is resolved

. check if midPoint is running and working properly and the logging works again

* subsequently, the resource with the error is marked as "down" in the resource list

*Reason*:

* `midPoint` cannot communicate with the resource - possibly firewall/network problem

*Resolution*:

. try to connect to the resource/port using telnet from midPoint machine

. check the network connections and firewall(s) between midPoint and resource and configure it properly

. go to menu:Resources[All resources] and test connection for the resource

. edit the user with account on the fixed resource and expand the account attributes.
Pending changes (if any) should be automatically applied.

[NOTE]
====
Think about running Shadow refresh task or Reconciliation task for the failed resource after you fix the connection problem.

=== Failed synchronization task remediation

If midPoint is executing synchronization tasks in background, it is also checking the results of synchronization of individual objects.
If there is a problem, the synchronization task will follow one of the following scenarios:

* *configuration exception*: task will suspend itself.
An example may be that administrator has misconfigured the resource which is being synchronized

* *non-permanent error*: task will not suspend itself, it will continue its execution.
The object with error will be probably not synchronized correctly, but the other objects will continue to be synchronized.
The error will be visible in the task "Result" or "Errors" panel
If the issue is connection-related, midPoint may continue to poll the resource again.

* *permanent error*: task will suspend itself.

In all cases, synchronization errors will be visible in `midpoint.log` file.
Also a notification can be configured which will send an email/SMS if task is suspended because of an error.

If the task has been suspended because of synchronization problem, use the following steps:

* Search for exceptions in `midpoint.log`. Usually the exception will include also stack trace, which will be quite "visible" in the log file. Try to understand the problem from the error message near the exception.

* Fix the server communication problem, resource configuration problem or problem with specific user data.

* If the problem has been resolved, you can resume the task again.
Based on the task type, task can either continue (LiveSync) or restart (Reconciliation).


=== Removing old reports as a prevention of full disk

If midPoint reports are created and executed, there are two kinds of output data for each report:

* the repository object of `ReportData` type referencing (among others) the actual report output (file on disk)

* the report output (file on disk)

The report outputs or the corresponding files can be deleted manually from midPoint, but the *Cleanup task* can be configured to do so automatically.

[TIP]
====
If you are using multiple nodes in midPoint cluster, the reports output files will be stored on the machine running report.
In order to access the reports from any machine, you need to create a shared directory/filesystem which will be accessible from all midPoint nodes as `$midpoint.home/export` directory.

Otherwise the reports will be downloadable only on the machine where they were created.
====

midPoint `Cleanup task` can be configured to automatically delete old report outputs.
This can be configured in `System configuration` object using the following steps:

* go to menu:Configuration[Repository objects].

* select `System configuration` in the combo list.

* Click `SystemConfiguration` object.

* Scroll down and search the `<cleanupPolicy>` section and update it with a new `<outputReports>` part:
+
[source,xml,highlight='9-11']
----
. . .
<cleanupPolicy>
      <auditRecords>
         <maxAge>P3M</maxAge>
      </auditRecords>
      <closedTasks>
         <maxAge>P1M</maxAge>
      </closedTasks>
      <outputReports>
         <maxAge>P2M</maxAge><!--1-->
      </outputReports>
   </cleanupPolicy>
. . .
----
<1> the report outputs will be automatically deleted after 2 months

* save the `System configuration` object by clicking btn:[Save]

TIP: Instead of modification of `SystemConfiguration` via midPoint, you can also upload it using MidPoint Studio. You can also use midPoint GUI to configure the cleanup policy - please refer to <<cleanup_policy>>.

=== Fix corrupted midPoint objects

*Symptoms:*

You encounter _corrupted_ midPoint objects that are not editable from the related UI, and an error.

*Resolution:*

These corrupted objects should be removed or edited manually from the source XML:

. Go to icon:file-alt[] *Repository objects* > icon:circle[] *All objects*.
. Select the related object type in the *Type* drop-down menu.
. Either delete the corrupted object, or fix it by editing it.

If your XML files are corrupted to a level at which they are unreadable in the Repository objects view, delete the corrupted objects directly in the midPoint DB console (the steps below apply only to the native repository):

. Copy the OID of the corrupted object in the Repository objects view accessed above.
. Log in to the midPoint DB console:
+
[source,bash]
----
psql -U midpoint
----
. In the midPoint DB console, use SQL to delete the corrupted object from the related tables. See the example below:
+
[source,psql]
----
# connect to midpoint database
\c midpoint
----
+
[source,sql]
----
# check if exists in m_object table and then delete
SELECT * FROM m_object WHERE oid = '<oid>';
DELETE FROM m_object where oid = '<oid>';
# check if exists in m_object_oid table and then delete
SELECT * FROM m_object_oid  WHERE oid = '<oid>';
DELETE FROM m_object_oid  WHERE oid = '<oid>';
# check if exists in m_report table and then delete
SELECT * FROM m_report WHERE oid = '<oid>';
DELETE FROM m_report  WHERE oid = '<oid>';
----

[NOTE]
====
The database schema can vary in different midPoint versions.
Refer to the xref:/midpoint/release/[release notes] for specific midPoint versions.
====

== Security and Access Control

The vast majority of data stored in midPoint is stored in the database repository.
The access to the data from midPoint can be limited using the concept of authorizations.
The raw access to the data from outside of midPoint must be limited by the database and network configuration.
In addition, the sensitive data in the database (such as passwords) are either encrypted or hashed and the encryption key is not stored in the database.

=== Authorizations for Operations

MidPoint roles can be used to provide and limit access control over data in midPoint.
There are two types of authorizations:

* *entry point authorizations*: webservice or GUI authorizations allow access specific interface at all (e.g. web service) or specific pages in midPoint GUI.

* *model authorizations*: triplets or subject, operation and object allow or deny access to specific objects or operations for various subjects.

The default access security policy is to deny all requests unless explicitly permitted.

There are two builtin basic security roles pre-configured using the authorizations:

* *Superuser*: users assigned to this role have all permissions in midPoint

* *End user*: users assigned to this role have basic self-service capabilities to log in to midPoint, view their profiles, change passwords etc.
They have no access control over other objects, just their accounts in midPoint and target systems.

The roles can be customized if needed and any number of different roles can be created to support delegated administration.

There is also a small number of files stored on disk, not in the database repository which should be also be protected.


=== Files on disk (midpoint.home)

The files on disk in the `midpoint.home` directory should be protected using the operation system file access control.
The files should be readable and writable only by the technical user which runs the application server with midPoint:

* `config.xml`: this file contains the database username and password.

* `keystore.jceks`: this file contains the encryption keys for sensitive information such as passwords in midPoint

== System Configuration

The main midPoint configuration is placed in the following places:

* On disk: `midpoint.home/config.xml` file

* In DB repository: `System configuration` object

The `config.xml` file is used to set up database repository connection, as documented in link:https://docs.evolveum.com/midpoint/reference/repository/configuration/[Repository Configuration].

The following chapter describes additional configuration parameters in `config.xml` file.
Any change in the file requires midPoint restart.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure you keep the files in `midpoint.home` directory content synchronized between all midPoint instances.
====


=== Clustering (High Availability) support

To create midPoint cluster, you need multiple midPoint nodes using the same database repository.

Install midPoint as usual on all cluster nodes.
You need to install the same midPoint version

We assume that you have already started midPoint at least once.

The following steps allow the cluster to be built and operated.

NOTE: Make sure time is synchronized on all midPoint nodes!

TIP: Start with turning on the cluster support on one of the nodes, then continue with the second node etc. You must restart midPoint if you change `config.xml` file. Keep watching `midpoint.log` file in all cluster nodes.

==== Enabling clustered option

Setup the clustered Task Manager in *all midPoint nodes* using *either*:

* use environment variable `MP_SET_midpoint_taskManager_clustered=true`
* use a command-line parameter `-Dmidpoint.taskManager.clustered=true`
* use the element in `config.xml`

.config.xml file:
[source,xml,highlight='8']
----
<configuration>
    . . .
    <midpoint>
        <repository>
        . . .
        </repository>
        <taskManager>
            <clustered>true</clustered> <!--1-->
        </taskManager>
    </midpoint>
</configuration>
----
<1> enabling `clustered` option for this node

==== Node identifiers

Setup unique node identifiers for *all midPoint nodes* using *either*:

* use environment variable `MP_SET_midpoint_nodeId` with a unique value, e.g. `MP_SET_midpoint_nodeId=node01`
* use a command-line parameter `-Dmidpoint.nodeId` for midPoint process with a unique value, e.g.: `-Dmidpoint.nodeId=node01`
* use the `<nodeId>` element in `config.xml`, e.g.:
+
[source,xml,highlight='8,10']
----
<configuration>
    . . .
    <midpoint>
        <repository>
        . . .

            <clustered>true</clustered> <!--1-->
        </taskManager>
        <nodeId>node01</nodeId> <!--2-->
    </midpoint>
</configuration>
----
<1> enabling `clustered` option for this node
<2> setting `nodeId` explicitly for this node

* use environment variable `MP_SET_midpoint_nodeIdSource=hostname`  or `MP_SET_midpoint_nodeIdSource=random` to allow midPoint to generate the `nodeId` automatically based on server's hostname or a random string, respectively
* use a command-line parameter `-Dmidpoint.nodeIdSource=hostname` or `-Dmidpoint.nodeIdSource=random`
* use the `<nodeIdSource>` element in `config.xml`, e.g.:
+
[source,xml,highlight='8,10']
----
<configuration>
    . . .
    <midpoint>
        <repository>
        . . .
        </repository>
        <taskManager>
            <clustered>true</clustered> <!--1-->
        </taskManager>
        <nodeIdSource>hostname</nodeIdSource> <!--2-->
    </midpoint>
</configuration>
----
<1> enabling `clustered` option for this node
<2> setting `nodeIdSource` to `hostname` explicitly for this node

TIP: Using `<nodeIdSource>hostname</nodeIdSource>` seems to be more flexible approach if you are running midPoint on several cluster nodes with different hostnames as you can use a single `config.xml` file on a shared disk for all cluster nodes.

==== Cluster URL Override

In some cases you need to configure the cluster URL so that midPoint nodes can see each other. This is used to detect which nodes are working and which are down.

The algorithm of cluster URL configuration is the following (in order of evaluation):

. if midPoint `<node>` object (in repository) contains `<urlOverride>` property, it is used
. `-Dmidpoint.url` command-line property or `<url>` property from `config.xml` is used
. if `SystemConfiguration` object contains the `<infrastructure><intraClusterHttpUrlPattern>. . .</intraClusterHttpUrlPattern></infrastructure>` property, it is used. The property can use the following macros:
* `$host` for host name (obtained dynamically from OS or overridden via `-Dmidpoint.hostname` or `<hostname>` property from  `config.xml` file)
* `$port`  for HTTP port (obtained dynamically from Tomcat JMX objects or overridden via `-Dmidpoint.httpPort` command-line property)
* `$path` for midPoint URL path (obtained dynamically from the servlet container)
. cluster URL is derived from the Tomcat JMX objects: protocol scheme, host name, port, and servlet path, as `scheme://host:port/path`.

[TIP]
====
You might need to override the cluster URL if your nodes cannot communicate with each other on the standard JMX ports because of the firewall restrictions.

Imagine the following example:

* you are running two midPoint nodes on two hosts, both using ports 8080
* both midPoint nodes are not directly accessible, they are behind Apache Http servers configured as reverse proxy servers, both using ports 80. Both Apache Http servers can be behind a load balancer.
* firewall blocks the communication on midPoint nodes, ports 8080 (they cannot communicate with each other using ports 8080)
* firewall allows the communication between midPoint nodes, ports 80
* cluster URL would be derived as `http://$host:$port/midpoint`, but `$port` would stand for `8080`, as this is the Tomcat JMX address
* you would need to override the cluster URL to: `http://$host:80/midpoint` (port `80` instead of `8080`) using the above mentioned mechanisms. For a concrete example, you could either use:
** the configuration in `SystemConfiguration` object (shared for all nodes):
+
[source,xml,subs="+quotes"]
----
<systemConfiguration>
. . .
    <infrastructure>
        <intraClusterHttpUrlPattern>*http://$host:80/midpoint*</intraClusterHttpUrlPattern>
    </infrastructure>
</systemConfiguration>
----
** or you can configure your `config.xml` (`<url>`) or `-Dmidpoint.url` for all nodes (the values will be different for all nodes).
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Setting `-Dmidpoint.httpPort` does not change the actual HTTP port for the embedded server.
See link:#changing-the-midpoint-embedded-tomcat-configuration[this section] to do that.
====

==== Checking Cluster Communication

Start all midPoint nodes and go to menu:Nodes[All nodes].

You should see that all nodes can see each other and there are no communication problems (*Status message* column).

TIP: When troubleshooting these mechanisms you can set logging for `com.evolveum.midpoint.task.quartzimpl.cluster.NodeRegistrar` (or the whole task manager module) to `DEBUG`.


=== Directory with custom connectors

The directory which can be used to contain custom ConnId connectors is configured in the following section of `config.xml` file:

.config.xml file: Custom ConnId Connectors Directory
[source,xml]
----
    <icf>
      <scanClasspath>true</scanClasspath>
      <scanDirectory>${midpoint.home}/icf-connectors</scanDirectory>
    </icf>
----

There is usually no need to change the default location.


=== Keystore configuration

The keystore file contains midPoint encryption key used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information.
The key is generated automatically upon first midPoint start.
The default cipher size is AES\_128.

The keystore file and default encryption key name (alias) are configured in the following section of `config.xml` file:

.config.xml: Keystore Parameters
[source,xml]
----
    <keystore>
      <keyStorePath>${midpoint.home}/keystore.jceks</keyStorePath>
      <keyStorePassword>changeit</keyStorePassword>
      <encryptionKeyAlias>default</encryptionKeyAlias>
    </keystore>
----

The encryption key can be changed to use different cipher size.

[NOTE]
====
There can be multiple keys in the keystore, even if only one is used for data *encryption*. To *decrypt* data encrypted previously, the old keys must be kept in the keystore.
All encrypted data contains information about the key that was used for encryption and the same key will be used for decryption.

As a rule of thumb, do not remove old keys from the keystore unless they are no more in use.
====


==== Adding new encryption key

Stop midPoint (all instances) before creating and using new encryption key.

You can use `keytool` to generate the new key with the name `strong`.
Please replace keystore path and key parameters as required:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *keytool -genseckey -alias strong -keystore /opt/midpoint/var/keystore.jceks -storetype jceks -storepass changeit -keyalg AES -keysize 256 -keypass midpoint*
----


The previous command creates a new key with AES_256 cipher named `strong`.
The key is stored in the keystore, but midPoint will not use it unless you configure it.

Update `config.xml` file with the new key information:

.config.xml: Keystore Parameters
[source,xml,highlight='4,5']
----
    <keystore>
      <keyStorePath>${midpoint.home}/keystore.jceks</keyStorePath>
      <keyStorePassword>changeit</keyStorePassword>
      <encryptionKeyAlias>strong</encryptionKeyAlias>
      <xmlCipher>http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#aes256-cbc</xmlCipher>
    </keystore>
----

If you are using midPoint cluster, you must use the same encryption key in all instances.
In simple cases you can simply copy the `keystore.jceks` file and `config.xml` to other instances.

Start midPoint (all instances) after changing the encryption key.
You should be able to login as usual.
From now, all newly encrypted data (such as changed passwords) will use the new encryption key (`strong`).


==== Adding target system certificates

The same keystore can be used also to contain certificates for remote systems accessed by the connectors.
To do this, the following option must be configured for JVM running midPoint e.g. in systemd service file (replace `/opt/midpoint/var` with your `midpoint.home` location):

[source]
----
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/opt/midpoint/var/keystore.jceks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=jceks
----

The following chapter describes "System configuration" object parameters.


=== Changing Security policy

If you need to change the global security policy which will be used for midPoint Users, please follow these steps.

* go to menu:System[System]
* Click btn:[Edit] in *Global security policy* field.
* Select appropriate value from the list of all security policies in the midPoint repository.
+
[NOTE]
====
Please be sure to select correct security policy.
The policy must already exist in the midPoint repository.
Changing the global security policy influences all User objects from now on.

====

* Save the selection by clicking btn:[Save] button


=== Changing Object templates

If you need to change object template which will be used for midPoint objects (e.g. Users), please follow these steps:

* go to menu:System[Object policy]
* Click btn:[Edit] in *Object template reference* column for appropriate object policy (e.g. for User objects, the (readonly) row in the Object policies field will end with UserType.
* A new popup window appears.
* Select appropriate value from the list of all Object Policies in the midPoint repository.

[NOTE]
====
Please be sure to select correct object template.
The template must already exist in the midPoint repository.
Changing the object template influences the creation and modification of all objects of selected object type (e.g. Users) from now on.
====

* Save the selection by clicking btn:[Save] button

[#cleanup_policy]
=== Cleanup Policy

Midpoint has an automatized way how to remove old audit and closed task data from the repository.This is done via a recurring cleanup task which is executed periodically by default every 24 hours.By default, this task removes all audit records older than 3 months and task records older than 1 month.

To change the default configuration please do the following:

* go to menu:System[Cleanup Policy]
* expand the corresponding containers
* set the *Cleanup interval* for the corresponding policies
* save the configuration by clicking btn:[Save] button

=== Notifications Configuration

The notifications are used to deliver messages based on various events in midPoint. E-mail, SMS and redirection to file(s) are supported.

The basic configuration for e-mail notifications is available from midPoint GUI. Configuration of other transports or the behaviour is currently possible only using XML configuration.

Access the Notifications page by going to menu:System[Notifications].

You can update the *Mail configuration* or the *Mail servers*


To add a new mail server for e-mail based notifications, click the btn:[+] button in the *Mail Servers*. Fill in the required settings based on your e-mail server configuration. You can have multiple SMTP servers which will be used for sending e-mails (round-robin).

Existing mail server configuration can be modified by selecting the appropriate mail server.

Save the changes by clicking on btn:[Save] button.

If you wish to use your existing notifications configuration, but avoid sending any real e-mails, you can redirect the notifications to the file configured in *Redirect to file* field.


=== Logging

MidPoint is using logback for logging. You can configure the following for logging:

* what is being logged (loggers)

* how much is being logged - verbosity (log level)

* where is the information logged (appenders)

You can configure multiple loggers with different log levels and store the information in separate appenders (usually the files). The default configuration is set to disable debugging information.

The values for this parameters might be quite custom for each deployment while the verbosity of loggers which are set up and the number logged operation should be considered.

Access the Logging page by going to menu:System[Logging].

The modifications can be done in the *Appenders* section of the window. Click an existing appender name you wish to update:

* Pattern: the message format. E.g.: `%date [%X{subsystem}] [%thread] %level \(%logger\): %msg%n`

* *File name*: where the file will be stored. E.g. `${midpoint.home}/log/midpoint.log`

* *File pattern*: how the rotated logs file name will be constructed. E.g. `${midpoint.home}/log/midpoint-%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.%i.log`
** in order to compress rotated logs, the *File pattern* should end with `.gz` extension, e.g. `${midpoint.home}/log/midpoint-%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.%i.log.gz`

* *Max history*: how many _days_ of log history should be kept

* *Max file size*: how big the log file can be before  rotation occurs. E.g.: `100MB`

* *Append*: check to append the information to the file; otherwise the fill be truncated

TIP: String `${midpoint.home}` represents the "midPoint Home" directory.

If necessary, you can create a new appender by clicking btn:[+] while selecting *File appender*:


* *Pattern*: the message format (you can copy the value from `MIDPOINT_LOG`). E.g.: `%date [%X{subsystem}] [%thread] %level \(%logger\): %msg%n`

* *Name*: name of the appender. E.g. `MIDPOINT_PROV_LOG`

* *File name*: where the file will be stored. You can copy the value from `MIDPOINT_LOG`, but change the file name! E.g. `${midpoint.home}/log/midpoint-prov.log`

* *File pattern*: how the rotated logs file name will be constructed.You can copy the value from `MIDPOINT_LOG`, but change the file name!E.g. `${midpoint.home}/log/midpoint-prov-%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.%i.log`
** in order to compress rotated logs, the *File pattern* should end with `.gz` extension, e.g. `${midpoint.home}/log/midpoint-prov-%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.%i.log.gz`



* *Max history*: how many days of log history should be kept

* *Max file size*: how big the log file can be before rotation occurs.E.g.: `100MB`

* *Append*: check to append the information to the file; otherwise the fill be truncated

Click btn:[Done] button, then click btn:[Save] button.

The new appender will be used only if some of the loggers will be configured to use it.


[#_syslog_logging]
=== Syslog Logging

MidPoint is using logback for logging.By default is configured to log to `midpoint.log` file.You can also configure logging to the Syslog server.

The following steps assume `rsyslogd` installation.

Create a new file `/etc/rsyslog.d/99-midpoint.conf` on your syslog server with the following contents:

./etc/rsyslogd.d/99-midpoint.conf file:
[source,bash]
----
local3.*			/var/log/midpoint.log
----

Check and configure remote logging in `/etc/rsyslog.conf` file:

./etc/rsyslog.conf file
[source]
----
# provides UDP syslog reception
module(load="imudp")
input(type="imudp" port="514")
----

[NOTE]
====
You may need to adjust your firewall rules between midPoint server(s) and syslog server.

====

Restart rsyslogd:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *sudo systemctl restart rsyslog.service*
----

Test rsyslogd configuration with the command:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *logger -p local3.info Syslog check with midpoint configuration*
----

File `/var/log/midpoint.log` should be created and contain the message.

* go to menu:Repository objects[All objects]
* edit `System configuration` object
* append a new appender configuration for `SYSLOG_LOG`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<appender xsi:type="c:SyslogAppenderConfigurationType" name="SYSLOG_LOG" <!--1-->
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <syslogHost>syslog.example.com</syslogHost> <!--2-->
    <facility>LOCAL3</facility> <!--3-->
    <suffixPattern>[%X{subsystem}] [%thread] %level \(%logger\): %msg</suffixPattern>
</appender>
----
<1> this appender is named `SYSLOG_LOG`
<2> remote syslog server location (you may want to use `localhost`). Port `514` is assumed.
<3> syslog facility
* save `System configuration` object

* go to menu:System[Logging]
* set the *Root appender* (or any other appenders) to `SYSLOG_LOG
* click btn:[Save] button

[TIP]
====
You may also want to overwrite the existing appender configuration (default: `MIDPOINT_LOG`) in the `System configuration` object. In such case, the XML code above needs to contain: `name="MIDPOINT_LOG"` and you need to replace the existing appender for `MIDPOINT_LOG` in `System configuration` instead of adding a new.
====

[NOTE]
====
You may need to configure log rotation for the log file in your operating system.
====

To test the logging, you may want to test connection to some resource (e.g. LDAP) which will force some messages to be printed.

Go to Syslog server and check the messages in `/var/log/midpoint.log`

If you see the messages, logging to Syslog server is properly configured.


[#_resource_decommission]
=== Resource decommission

Typically you don't want to fully decommission the resource. You want to keep it in inactive state to make sure your audit logs will work properly and will not reference non-existing objects. This case is not fully documented yet and the steps might vary based on particular environment. Contact our support if you have this case and need a help with it.

If you just need to completely remove the resources and you don't need it even for auditing purposes, use the following steps.

. Stop all tasks related to the resource (e.g. reconciliation) and delete them.
. Remove configuration that was related to the resource. Mostly inducements with account construction for given resource, but there might be other parts of configuration which are referencing this resource (e.g. dashboards, reports, notification, conditions in mappings).
. Delete all shadow objects for this resource and delete the resource itself.
. MidPoint will automatically detect linked accounts to non-existing shadows and removes them automatically as part of other operations when it works with linked accounts. Alternatively, you can recompute the affected objects (e.g. all users) to do the cleanup immediately.


[#running_monitoring_and_alerting]
== Running, Monitoring and Alerting


=== Starting and Stopping midPoint

midPoint is a web application using its own embedded Tomcat server (stand-alone deployment).
This means you do not need to install any other server to run midPoint.

[NOTE]
====
Explicit deployment of war file to web container is deprecated. Apache Tomcat 9.0 (9.0.48) is supported.

Apache Tomcat 8.0.x and 8.5.x are no longer supported. Support for explicit deployment to newer Tomcat versions is not planned. Please migrate to the default stand-alone deployment model as soon as possible.

This document assumes the usage of embedded Tomcat server only.
====

==== Using embedded Tomcat (Linux)

The following steps assume the midPoint installation in `/opt/midpoint` directory, owned (both directory and its content) as (previously created) user `midpoint`. The systemd service will be started as user `midpoint` and will listen on default TCP 8080 port.

.midpoint.service file example for midPoint 4.4.x and 4.5.x:
[source,bash]
----
[Unit]
Description=MidPoint Standalone Service
###Requires=postgresql.service
###After=postgresql.service
[Service]
User=midpoint
WorkingDirectory=/opt/midpoint
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java \
  -Xmx4096m \
  -Dmidpoint.home=/opt/midpoint/var \
  -jar /opt/midpoint/lib/midpoint.war
SuccessExitStatus=143
###TimeoutStopSec=120s
[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

.midpoint.service file example for midPoint 4.6 and later (`midpoint.war` replaced with `midpoint.jar`):
[source,bash]
----
[Unit]
Description=MidPoint Standalone Service
###Requires=postgresql.service
###After=postgresql.service
[Service]
User=midpoint
WorkingDirectory=/opt/midpoint
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java \
  -Xmx4096m \
  -Dmidpoint.home=/opt/midpoint/var \
  -jar /opt/midpoint/lib/midpoint.jar
SuccessExitStatus=143
###TimeoutStopSec=120s
[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

The systemd service file can be generated by using the following command:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ */opt/midpoint/bin/midpoint.sh generate*
----

The service file is generated on the standard output. You need to copy/paste it to a systemd service file as instructed by the script output.

To customize JVM parameters, you can use the following environmental variables before calling `midpoint.sh generate`:

MP_USER=username::
Run midPoint as user username
MP_MEM_MAX=value::
Value for Xmx JVM parameter
MP_MEM_INIT=value::
Value for Xms JVM parameter
MP_SET_SpecialVariable=value::
Value for SpecialVariable will be set to value
MP_SET_java_xxx_yyy_zzz=value::
Value for java.xxx.yyy.zzz will be set to value

A more complete example of calling `midpoint.sh generate` to create a proper systemd service file:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *MP_USER=mpuser MP_MEM_INIT=16g MP_MEM_MAX=16g /opt/midpoint/bin/midpoint.sh generate*
----

This would generate the systemd service file containing:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----

. . .
[Service]
User=*mpuser*
ExecStart="java" -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager *-Xmx16g* *-Xms16g* -Dpython.cachedir="/opt/midpoint/var/tmp" -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore="/opt/midpoint/var/keystore.jceks" -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=jceks -Dmidpoint.home="/opt/midpoint/var" -jar "/opt/midpoint/lib/midpoint.war"
. . .
----

[TIP]
====
Systemd allows you to specify service dependencies.
For example to specify that midPoint requires PostgreSQL database running as systemd service on the same host, just uncomment the lines `Requires` and `After`. Systemd will start PostgreSQL before midPoint, and when PostgreSQL goes down, it will also automatically shut down midPoint.
====

After creating or updating systemd service file for midPoint, you need to execute the following:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *sudo systemctl daemon-reload*
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *sudo systemctl enable midpoint*
----

To start midPoint using systemd service:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *sudo systemctl start midpoint*
----

To stop midPoint running as a systemd service:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *sudo systemctl stop midpoint*
----

To restart midPoint running as a systemd service:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *sudo systemctl restart midpoint*
----


To disable automatic midPoint startup/shutdown, use the following command:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *sudo systemctl disable midpoint*
----

////
// This section is deprecated and talks about unsupported Tomcat 8
==== Using external Tomcat

midPoint is started and stopped whenever Tomcat server is started or stopped. On Linux servers, the usual startup scripts can be used to start/stop midPoint manually or automatically using the operating system means,  whenever the server starts or shuts down.

To start midPoint on Linux server with Tomcat manually, use one of the commands (depending on your distribution):

[source,bash]
----
sudo service tomcat8 start
sudo systemctl start tomcat8
sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat8 start
----

To start midPoint on Windows server with Tomcat installed as service manually, start the service through Services by selecting Start the service link or Start service button for Tomcat service.

If midPoint has been successfully started, the `midpoint.log` file should contain the following messages:

.midpoint.log file:

[NOTE]
====
If the database repository is running on the same machine as midPoint, make sure that Tomcat is started *after* the database repository for midPoint has been started.
Otherwise midPoint will be unable to start.
This can be configured using dependencies between the services.
====

To stop midPoint on Linux server with Tomcat manually, use one of the commands (depending on your distribution):

[source,bash]
----
sudo service tomcat8 stop
sudo systemctl stop tomcat8
sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat8 stop
----

To stop midPoint on Windows server with Tomcat installed as service manually, stop the service through Services by selecting Stop the service link or Stop service button for Tomcat service.

If midPoint has been successfully stopped, the  `midpoint.log` file should contain the following messages:

----


[NOTE]
====
If the database repository is running on the same machine as midPoint, make sure that Tomcat is stopped *before* the database repository for midPoint is stopped.
Otherwise midPoint may not be able to shutdown correctly.
This can be configured using dependencies between the services.

////

=== Changing the midPoint Embedded Tomcat Configuration

Default configuration is packaged inside `midpoint.war` file, but there are ways how to change it without modifying the binary file:

* You can create `application.yml` or `application.properties` file in your `$midpoint.home` directory and add the configuration changes there.
The content of this file takes precedence over the defaults from the bundled `application.yml` file.
* *MP_SET_SpecialVariable=value* +
This option transform the entry to the form of `-D`.
For more information how it is handled is available on xref:/midpoint/install/bare-installation/midpoint-sh/[Start script] doc page.
More information about embedded Tomcat options can be found on xref:/midpoint/devel/guides/environment/embedded-tomcat.adoc[embedded Tomcat] environment doc page.
* You can add JVM arguments to set system properties matching the property names from the config file with `-D` switch.
This takes precedence even over the custom `application.yml` file.
Using the command line switches may also be more convenient for containerized midPoint.
The switches can be delivered via `midpoint.sh` using `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable,
or specified in the service configuration.
* Similar to above, you can use alternative syntax `--key=value` which can be used as a program argument.
This means that while `-Dkey=value` goes *before* the name of the application (WAR/JAR),
`--key=value` goes *after* the application name and can be also provided as argument to `midpoint.sh` or `start.sh`.
Note there is no `D` (just mentally replace it with that second dash `-`).

For example, to change the default HTTP listener port, you can create `application.yml` (or
`application.properties`, if you prefer that format) file in your `$midpoint.home` directory.

.example of MP_SET_SpecialVariable=value option:
[source,bash]
----
MP_SET_server_port=8088 /opt/midpoint/bin/midpoint.sh start
----

.application.yml file in midpoint.home directory:
[source,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 8088
----

.application.properties file in midpoint.home directory:
[source,properties]
----
server.port=8088
----

After any change in `application.yml` you need to restart midPoint by stopping and starting the service using the commands specified above.

Alternatively, provide the JVM argument to set the system property matching the property name
from the configuration file, for example:
[source,bash]
----
-Dserver.port=8088
----

This can be added to `JAVA_OPTS` or to the systemd service configuration.

Or you can use application argument like this:
[source,bash]
----
--server.port=8088
----

But this must go *after* the name of the WAR/JAR in the systemd configuration.
It can be also used as an argument to `midpoint.sh` and `start.sh` scripts.
Of course, this form will not work in `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable.

[NOTE]
====
We do not recommend running midPoint listening on privileged ports ( < 1024, e.g. 80).
This would require midPoint running as root.
Instead, we recommend creating a reverse proxy before midPoint, e.g. using Apache HTTP Server.
====

There are other configuration changes that can be done the same way.
For instance, to change the default URL context from `midpoint`, set `server.servlet.context-path`
to any other value, e.g. `/mypoint` (must start with `/`) or to `/` to run the GUI in the root context.

[TIP]
====
The mentioned techniques, the local `application.yml` file, JVM arguments and program arguments,
are standard ways how to configure application based on Spring Boot (which midPoint is).
If you're interested in more details, see their https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config[Externalized Configuration] documentation.
====

// TODO AJP documentation? (non-documented, but used, no experimental status)
// See this part of bundled application.yml: https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/blob/375f6525a79d4c23de2dd801114cd3ebef0259bb/gui/admin-gui/src/main/resources/application.yml#L19
// Also see supported options in the code: https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/blob/f6f0574ec2037f3d602eff65e3a7f1cf131393d7/gui/admin-gui/src/main/java/com/evolveum/midpoint/web/boot/EmbeddedTomcatAutoConfiguration.java#L54

////
If you need to change Java used by midPoint or the JVM parameters, you need to change `JAVA_HOME` environmental variable or `JAVA_OPTS`, respectively. Use `bin/setenv.sh` script located in the midPoint directory:

.bin/setenv.sh file:
[source,bash]
----
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/java
export JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xmx4096m"
----

After this change you need to restart midPoint by stopping and starting the service using the commands specified above.


==== Using external Tomcat
// This section is deprecated and talks about unsupported Tomcat 8


If you need to change default HTTP listener port, you can do it in server.xml file. The file location depends on the operating system. For Ubuntu 16.04 the file is located at `/etc/tomcat8/server.xml`.

Update the following section by replacing 8080 with your required port number:

[source,xml]
----
    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               URIEncoding="UTF-8"
               redirectPort="8443" maxPostSize="-1" />
----

 After this change you need to restart Tomcat by stopping and starting the service using the commands specified above.

[NOTE]
====
We do not recommend running Tomcat listening on privileged ports ( 1024, e.g. 80).
This would require Tomcat running as root.
Instead we recommend to create a reverse proxy before Tomcat, e.g. using Apache HTTP Server.
====

If you need to change Java used by Tomcat (and midPoint) or the JVM parameters, you need to change JAVA_HOME environmental variable or JAVA_OPTS, respectively. For Ubuntu 16.04 you can change the `/etc/default/tomcat8` file by uncommenting and changing the variables:

./etc/default/tomcat8
[source,bash]
----
# The home directory of the Java development kit (JDK). You need at least
# JDK version 7. If JAVA_HOME is not set, some common directories for
# OpenJDK and the Oracle JDK are tried.
JAVA_HOME=/opt/java
# You may pass JVM startup parameters to Java here. If unset, the default
# options will be: -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx128m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
#
# Use "-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC" to enable the CMS garbage collector (improved
# response time). If you use that option and you run Tomcat on a machine with
# exactly one CPU chip that contains one or two cores, you should also add
# the "-XX:+CMSIncrementalMode" option.
JAVA_OPTS="-Dmidpoint.home=/var/opt/midpoint -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx1500m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC"
----

After this change you need to restart Tomcat by stopping and starting the service using the commands specified above.

=== Monitoring midPoint Status

To check if midPoint process is running, use the following steps:


==== Using embedded Tomcat (Linux)

You can check midPoint process status by using the following command:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *systemctl status midpoint*

Use `curl` to check if midPoint health actuator returns the following:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *curl http://<midpoint_host>/midpoint/actuator/health*

{"status":"UP"}
----

To check on which port midPoint is listening, you need the midPoint PID first:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *sudo systemctl status midpoint | grep PID*
 Main PID: 2058 (java)
----

or:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *ps -ef |grep midpoint | grep java*
midpoint  2058     1 13 12:47 ?        00:39:48 /usr/bin/java -Xmx3072m -Dmidpoint.home=/opt/midpoint/var -jar /opt/midpoint/lib/midpoint.war
midpoint  8371  2933  0 17:38 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto java
----

In both examples above, the PID is 2058.

To check on which ports PID 2058 listens, you can use netstat command:

[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
midpoint@midpoint:~ $ *sudo netstat -pevln |grep 2058*
tcp6       0      0 :::8080                 :::*                    LISTEN      1000       24243      2058/java
netstat: no support for `AF IPX' on this system.
netstat: no support for `AF AX25' on this system.
netstat: no support for `AF X25' on this system.
netstat: no support for `AF NETROM' on this system.
----

In the examples above the java process 2058 listens on TCP6 port 8080 (the standard port when using embedded Tomcat).

You can do this by checking the Status column for Tomcat in Services. The service runs if the status is Started.

Use your web browser and open the http[s]://midpoint_host/midpoint/status.html page. This is a static page displaying the text Alive if the application server is running.

First you need to know the process number (PID) of Tomcat. That can be achieved either by using startup script or simple ps command:

[source,bash]

In all examples above, the PID is 1273.

To check on which ports PID 1273 listens, you can use netstat command:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo netstat -pevln |grep 1273

netstat: no support for `AF IPX' on this system.

Similar result can be achived also with netstat command only when grepping java process:

[source,bash]

=== Checking midPoint status programatically using REST

midPoint is providing access to its objects using REST API, which can be used for remote monitoring using monitoring tools. The following setup will prepare authorization for a technical user `monitoring` - if this user can log in to midPoint, we assume midPoint runs.

NOTE: Your requirements may be different.

. Import the following role to midPoint:
+
.Example authorization role:
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<role xmlns="http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/common-3"
      oid="e8145095-0d5d-481e-9e9e-ae9bb2269c0b">
   <name>monitoring_role</name>
   <description>Access role for monitoring access</description>
   <activation>
      <effectiveStatus>enabled</effectiveStatus>
   </activation>
   <displayName>monitoring_role</displayName>
   <authorization>
      <name>monitoring-monitor-self-read</name>
      <action>http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-model-3#read</action>
      <object>
         <special>self</special>
      </object>
   </authorization>
   <authorization>
      <name>monitoring-monitor-rest</name>
      <action>http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-rest-3#all</action>
   </authorization>
</role>
----

. Create user `monitoring` in midPoint:
+
Either create `monitoring` user and assign `monitoring_role`, or import the following user object:
+
.Example technical user for monitoring
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

         <clearValue>checkme123!</clearValue>
         </value>
      </password>
   </credentials>
</user>
----

The user password from previous example is `checkme123!`. This user has assigned the `monitoring_role` role and is able to log in and get its own object.

In the following examples we assume midPoint accessible at http://localhost:8080/midpoint. Please adapt the URL as appropriate for your environment.

TIP: `curl -I ...` will fetch only headers.
Replace `-I` with `-v -X GET` to receive the whole object including headers.

[#troubleshooting]
== Troubleshooting

When you believe your midPoint installation is misbehaving or not working at all, the first place to look for problems is the log file `midpoint.log`.Please refer to <<common_errors>> chapter.

If the problem cannot be fixed with the help of the <<common_errors>> chapter, you may need to increase the logging.

=== Error Messages

MidPoint will print error messages using the following mechanisms:

midPoint log file, located either in:

* (stand-alone midPoint with Embedded Tomcat) `/opt/midpoint/var/log/midpoint.log` if your midPoint is installed in `/opt/midpoint`

* system log (if configured in midPoint logging configuration)

* GUI expandable error messages (only for operations initiated in GUI)

The best place for searching for error messages is the midPoint log (or system log if configured).

The first place to diagnose GUI-initiated operations is the expandable error message window displayed in case of errors.


=== Increase the logging

To configure logging, go to menu:System[Logging].

The log levels supported by midPoint components, sorted by _severity_ are: *TRACE < DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR* There is also a special log level: *OFF* to switch off logging completely.

The log levels can be specified for whole midPoint, different midPoint components or specific packages/classes.

The logging configuration in midPoint specifies, which messages will be logged and which will be filtered out.
The message will be logged if its severity is higher than or equal the setting in midPoint logging configuration.
I.e. if you set the log level to `TRACE`, all logging messages with severity higher than or equal to `TRACE` (that is: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN` and `ERROR`) will be logged.

If you set the log level to `INFO`, only messages with severity `INFO`, `WARN` or `ERROR` will be logged.

Setting the log level to `OFF` will disable logging for the component completely.

The rule of thumb for log levels is: *do not use TRACE unless it's required by Evolveum*. If debugging problems, you can use `DEBUG` log level.
For normal operation, use either `INFO` (the default) or `WARN`.

After you increase the log level(s), try to replicate the problem.
If you believe the problem is caused by midPoint, you can report the issue.


=== Search Error Message in the log file

When searching for symptoms in the logfiles (e.g. `midpoint.log`), the following hints may be helpful.

. whenever possible, try to have direct access to midPoint log files, using a shell, so that you can use shell tools for better searching/filtering the log files
. if running a single-node midpoint: be sure to check the correct log file (`midpoint.log` by default, unless you are using different appenders or you are <<_syslog_logging,logging to Syslog>>)
. if running cluster: be sure to check the logs for the correct node. You should be able to see the date/time of the event along with the node identifier in the audit log or in the task details

==== Searching by severity

The log messages contain the message severity by default. This means you can search by substring such as: *ERROR*

.Example: searching by word ERROR:
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
2022-02-21 10:14:59,871 [] [main] *ERROR* (org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication): Application run failed
org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextException: Unable to start web server; nested exception
. . .
----

==== Searching by Exception

In case of errors, the error will be logged as Java exception. This means you can search by word *Exception*.

.Example: searching by word Exception:
[source,subs="+quotes"]

=== Task Performance Troubleshooting

See xref:/midpoint/reference/diag/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-task-performance/[].

=== Recover Lost Configuration in midPoint 4.9.1

Starting with midPoint 4.9.1, we changed the default PostgresSQL schema for the native repository structure to match the name of the user accessing the database, i.e., `midpoint`.
This approach is currently recommended for PostgresSQL environments and replaces previous configurations that point to the public schema.
The change may lead to an issue where you seemingly lose midPoint configuration if you re-initialize your environment.
Don't worry, though, *your data is safe*, and *this guide is here to help you resolve the situation*.

[NOTE]
====
If you've initialized your midPoint environment with a schema owned by the current user right from the start, this issue won't affect you even if you re-run the initialization script.
====

==== Affected Environment

There are a few conditions for the issue to occur:

. You have a working midPoint environment, possibly migrated from older midPoint versions. +
    You don't have to worry about any of this if you're setting up a midPoint environment from scratch.
. You run your midPoint using *Docker*. +
    You should be fine if you xref:/midpoint/install/#traditional-installation[installed midPoint from a distribution package] because in such a case, the initialization script is usually run manually only once.
. You executed the script for *repository initialization*. +
    This usually happens automatically in Docker environments, and the issue is the result of improper detection of existing environments.

==== How the Issue Manifests

As a user, you see the default login form.
Custom settings (e.g., self-registration, password reset) disappear from the login page.

After providing valid credentials, login is denied with the notice `Invalid username and/or password`.

===== Technical Reasons Behind the Issue

Using the public schema used to be a recommended default for Postgres DBs.
However, this has changed recently, and it's recommended to use the actual current user accessing the database instead.

This isn't an issue for new deployments.
For older deployments, there's a fall-back to the public schema to uphold the backward compatibility in case the current user's schema isn't available or is empty.

This means that as long as the current user's schema is empty, the public schema is used without an issue.

[TIP]
====
In the context of midPoint deployment, the _current user_ is always "midpoint".
====

However, if you run the initialization script and the check for an existing environment fails, the script initializes a new environment using the `CURRENT_USER` variable, which equals to `midpoint`.
At this point, there's a fresh new schema in the current user's name as well as the old working public schema.
And since using the current user is the new default, all requests end up in the new schema making it look like midPoint has been initialized from scratch and your data has been lost.

Fortunately, *nothing is lost*.
The public schema is still there.
Read on to learn how to recover it.

==== Solution to the Issue

To solve this issue and prevent it from recurring, rename or remove the newly created schema.
Then, rename the functional public schema to `midpoint`.
Additionally, transfer ownership of the functional schema to the current user to maintain a tidy and consistent setup.

* The public schema isn't mandatory and can be removed or transferred to the current user.
  Some sources recommend doing so.
* Operations are processed with preference for the current user's schema.

===== Remove the New Schema

If you want to clean up the database, this is the preferred option.

. Remove the newly initialized schema owned by the current user.
. Transfer the ownership of the functional public schema to the current user.
. Rename the previously public schema to `midpoint`.

All requests will land in the previously public schema now properly owned by the current user, i.e., `midpoint`.

===== Rename the New Schema

If you're not comfortable removing the newly created schema, you can use this solution instead.

. Rename the newly created fresh schema.
. Transfer the ownership of the functional public schema to the current user.
. Rename the previously public schema to `midpoint`.

The newly initialized repository will be available in the `midpoint_bcp` backup schema.
All requests will, however, land in the previously public schema, now properly named `midpoint`.

== Maintenance


=== Backup Requirements

The basic backup requirement is the fact that you would like the system up and running as easily as possible and as soon as possible.
This is mostly influenced by the backup frequency.

Most of midPoint data is stored in the database repository, so there must be enough place to back up the database according to the backup frequency.
The factors that influence the database (and backup) size are:

* the number of users and their accounts (or organizations, roles and entitlements) managed by midPoint

* the frequency of user (or organization or role) lifecycle changes which influences the audit log size

* the frequency of purging the audit log records

The rest of the data is file-based (within `midpoint.home` directory) and the size is usually minimal, also the data is seldom changed.


=== Backup Procedures

==== midpoint.home Backup

*Location*: each midPoint node, but we recommend keeping the files synchronized between nodes.

*Frequency*: do a backup each time you modify data in the `midpoint.home` directory, such as:

* *schema extension* modification (XSD file(s) in `midpoint.home/schema` directory)

* *custom connector* modification (JAR file(s) in `midpoint.home/icf-connectors` directory)

* *keystore* modification (`midpoint.home/keystore.jceks` file)

* *cluster authentication* files (`jmxremote.access` and `jmxremote.password` files)

* *exported data* from reports (files in `midpoint.home/export` directory)

* *main system configuration*: database repository location/connection string, encryption key usage etc. (`midpoint.home/config.xml` file)

==== Pre-Upgrade Repository Backup

*Location*: any midPoint node

*Frequency*: we recommend doing this kind of backup before midPoint upgrade.

Use the RDBMS tools to make a consistent backup of midPoint repository database.
Store the backup on safe place (outside the midPoint and RDBMS server(s) and on different disks than the database is located).

==== Regular Repository Backup

*Location*: any midPoint node

*Frequency*: daily, weekly or whatever is your policy for data backup

Use the RDBMS tools to make a consistent backup of midPoint repository database.
Store the backup on safe place (outside the midPoint and RDBMS server(s) and on different disks than the database is located).


=== Restore Procedures

To fully restore your midPoint environment after a complete system crash with data loss, use the following steps.

* If the midPoint server has been damaged, you need to create a new one or restore it from backup including midPoint installation.

* If midPoint is up and running, you can continue with the next step.

* If you reinstalled midPoint, you need to restore `midpoint.home` directory from backup to have the same configuration as before system crash.

* If the `midpoint.home` directory contains correct files, you can continue with the next step.

* If you modified midPoint's configuration for external authentication or customized LESS / CSS, you may need to restore that configuration in expanded midPoint web application.

* If the files are correct, you may continue with the next step.

* If the database repository was damaged during the system crash, you need to first re-create a new empty midPoint database using the midPoint documentation or even better, your own database creation scripts saved from the original installation.

* If the database is OK, you may continue with the next step.

* If the database repository was damaged during the system crash and you have re-created a new empty database, you have to restore the database repository content from the last available backup.
Use the RDBMS tools to reimport your backup of midPoint repository database.

* If the database content is OK, you may continue with the next step.

* Start midPoint and check that the database has been restored.

* To fully recover from midPoint outage due to a system crash, you need to resynchronize midPoint with your resources.

* If midPoint outage was long enough to miss the synchronization changes from the authoritative source(s):

** stop the LiveSync task(s) if you are using them

** we recommend running a reconciliation with source systems to fetch all missed changes

** delete the synchronization token in your LiveSync task(s) if you are using them - to force the tasks detect data from now

** start/resume the LiveSync task(s) if you are using them

* If midPoint outage was long enough to force IT personnel to create or modify accounts on your target systems without midPoint:

** configure and run reconciliation task for each resource to detect newly added accounts

** create corresponding users in midPoint for all such accounts and link them

[#upgrades]
=== Upgrades

midPoint upgrade usually consists of the following tasks:

* pre-upgrade preparation nad planning (reading release notes, preparing reconfiguration for deprecated/removed features or different behaviour)

* upgrading database schema

* upgrading web application

* post-upgrade tasks (automatic and manual)

The upgrade steps generally differ in complexity based on the upgrade level:

* upgrading to next maintenance/patch release (e.g. from 3.9 to 3.9.1) usually does not require any database schema changes, there will be no database schema upgrade script and the upgradability is trivial

* upgrading to supported minor version (e.g. from 3.8 to 3.9) usually requires database schema changes using vendor-prepared scripts and the upgradability is easy

* upgrading to supported major version (e.g. from 2.2 to 3.0) usually required database schema changes using vendor-prepared scripts and _may_ require some additional work

When skipping releases (e.g. from 3.7 to 3.9.1) you have to follow the upgrade path, i.e. to upgrade from 3.7 to 3.7.1, then to 3.8, then to 3.8.1, then to 3.9 and finally, to 3.9.1. You don't need to redeploy midPoint each time - it's OK to deploy just the target version, but you have to modify the database schema by running the database schema upgrade scripts in proper sequence and also follow release notes for _all_ releases.

[NOTE]
====
The release notes may contain additional or different steps required to do a successful upgrade. Such notes always take precedence over this generic approach documented here.
====

If you are skipping releases, be sure to read all release notes for all midPoint releases that you will skip in addition to the target midPoint release.

MidPoint upgrade will require you to stop provisioning (in case of the cluster, _all_ nodes).
You should inform all midPoint users and/or plan the upgrade accordingly.
As stated above, we really recommend to actually test and upgrade you other environments before going to the production.

Backup the database repository (using RDBMS tools) and consider exporting midPoint data as XML objects.
The export may be used to compare the objects before and after the upgrade procedure.

Backup your `midpoint.home` directory.

Backup your original midPoint (WAR file).
This might be especially handy to have backup of all built-in connectors bundled with the original version.

The DB schema upgrade scripts are located in `config/sql/native-new/` directory (Native PostgreSQL repository) in the midPoint distribution archives (including Activity and Quartz updates).

The scripts will upgrade from one specific original release to one specific target release, so if you are skipping midPoint releases, you need to collect all required scripts i.e. from 3.7 to 3.7.1, then from 3.7.1 to 3.8, then from 3.8 to 3.9.

You should prepare this in advance.

Before upgrading, you have to shut down all midPoint instances.

Run the database schema upgrade script / all database upgrade scripts in the correct sequence.
There should be no errors during this operation.
If you encounter any errors, please ensure you are running correct scripts (for your database) in correct order.

Install the new midPoint distribution archive, but do not remove/overwrite the original `midpoint.home` directory.

Start one of the nodes first.
Check if you can still login to midPoint (e.g. as administrator user).

When midPoint is starting, it will import all initial objects from `/opt/midpoint/lib/midpoint.war/WEB-INF/classes/initial-objects`, but only if such objects have not existed in the repository before.
All new configuration will be automatically imported.
But there are usually also changes in some of the already existing objects.
You have to review those changes manually and choose either to keep whatever you already have in repository, or reimport the object from `/opt/midpoint/lib/midpoint.war/WEB-INF/classes/initial-objects` or merge them.
The list of changes in initial objects is part of the Release notes.

A typical example of such change between versions is `End user` role, which is usually updated with new self-service authorizations.
Also `System Configuration` object usually contains new configuration.

If you are using bundled connectors (LDAP, CSV, Database Table), usually each midPoint upgrade bundles new versions of these connectors.
As a result, your existing resources using these connectors will not work until you change the connector reference in your resources.
You can do it by either using Resource Wizard, or you can re-upload your resources from your project directory and specify the correct version in connectorRef search filter.
After this you can remove old Connector objects from the repository.

Be sure to check also all other resources.

Occasionally you will need to update midPoint objects after upgrade, e.g. reinitialize resource capabilities, reindex database, modify authorization uris etc.,
or modify midPoint configuration if the behaviour has changed between the versions.
If you change midPoint configuration, be sure to save the changes also in your project directory.

Occasionally you will need to migrate your environment from using old connector to the new one (legacy LDAP connector to Polygon LDAP; legacy CSV connector to Polygon CSV etc).
Please read the release notes correctly and apply any required procedures.

Alternatively, if you cannot upgrade your environment at this time, you can temporarily keep the original built-in connectors (remember you should have backed them up before upgrade) by putting them to `midpoint.home/icf-connectors` directory.
Please note that the original versions of the connectors may not be supported anymore.

//If, after the upgrade, you need to re-apply the LESS customizations, modify the `midpoint.home/less/*.less` files or follow link:https://docs.evolveum.com/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/deployment-information/[Deployment Information] for simple customizations.

//LESS customizations have to be applied on all midPoint instances and it requires midPoint restart (except when using link:https://docs.evolveum.com/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/deployment-information/[Deployment Information Type]).

After you finish the upgrade procedure, start the remaining midPoint instances and test the behaviour in the upgraded midPoint.
Test all scenarios if possible.

Don't forget to test the REST webservice (if you are using it).

If your testing on single node is successful, you can start the other nodes of the cluster.

If your testing is successful in e.g. development environment, repeat the previous steps for testing and then for production environment.
Be sure to follow any notes you have made while following the procedures.

=== Patching

Patches are upgrades between official maintenance releases (e.g. from 3.9 to 3.9.1) or to support branch (e.g from 3.9.1 to 3.9.2-SNAPSHOT).
Patching _usually_ does not involve any database changes (make sure you read the appropriate Release notes and/or git commit messages).

The release notes are available only for official releases (e.g. 3.9 or 3.9.1), not for snapshots.

MidPoint patching usually consist of the following tasks:

* troubleshooting your issue (please see <<troubleshooting>> section for details)

* submitting a Bug Report (https://support.evolveum.com), if it was not already reported earlier. Please refer to xref:/support/bug-tracking-system/creating-a-bug-report/#submitting-a-bug-report[Submitting a Bug Report] for more information.

* contact Evolveum for planning resolution of the issue

* upgrading midPoint

* testing the resolution

[NOTE]
====
In case that you need not only the patch to the next maintenance version or support branch, but upgrade to newer minor or major version, please see <<upgrades>> section first.
====

Please follow these steps:

. Log in to midPoint, go to Configuration, *About* and see *Basic* section (`Version`, `Git describe`)

. Open https://support.evolveum.com/, try to find issue with same or similar symptoms, read details and comments.

. If you have identified your issue in our Support Portal, check the issue details.
Verify its *Status* and *Fix Version/s*.

* If *Status* is not `Resolved` or `Verified`, contact Evolveum.

* If *Status* is `Resolved` or `Verified` and *Fix version* (e.g. 3.9.1) is a maintenance release of the release you have (e.g. you have 3.9), refer to <<upgrades>> section.

* If *Status* is `Resolved` or `Verified` and your version is older than the *Fix version*, contact Evolveum in order to check possibility of backporting the fix into a maintenance version of the release you have.

. If you have not found your issue in our Issue Tracker, create a new issue as described in xref:/support/bug-tracking-system/creating-a-bug-report/#submitting-a-bug-report[Submitting a Bug Report].

. When resolution is done (you will receive automatic e-mail notification sent from the Issue Tracker or you just can watch the issue manually), wait one day, https://download.evolveum.com/midpoint/[download a new support build from here, e.g. from 4.4-support subdirectory] and install it to upgrade to that version in your testing environment.

+
[NOTE]
====
In some cases, Evolveum team can send special instructions what you need to do more than described in next steps.
====

. Verify the fixed version of midPoint in your test environment and make sure all other key use cases are not broken:

* Backup database repository, the current midpoint installation and `midpoint.home`

* Shut down all midPoint instances.

* Upgrade midPoint web application.

* Start one midPoint instance.

* Test upgraded midPoint instance.

* Start all other instances.

* Repeat tests.
+
[TIP]
====
For detailed information about these sub-steps.
please see chapter <<upgrades>>.
====

+
Use the previous sub-steps also in production and other environments where you need to deploy the patch.

=== Log purging and log rotation

MidPoint is using logback for log rotation. Log purging and log rotation can be customized quite easily by using the GUI.  For each appender you can configure:

* the maximum time period for which the log files are archived until deleted automatically (E.g. 10 days)

* the file size after which the log files are rotated (E.g. 100MB)

[TIP]
====
The defaults for log history are 10 days (not 10 files) and log rotation occurs daily / at 100MB file size - whichever comes first.

Please note that the time-based log rotation occurs only when the first log entry should be written after the time period has elapsed.
I.e. daily log rotation will happen only when midPoint tries to log first entry after midnight (which may be at 00:05 or 07:09).
In addition, if midPoint is down at that time, log rotation will occur when midPoint starts (so the startup can be a little slower).

When log rotation occurs, there is no explicit message notifying you of the rotation printed to the original log file at the moment. (Tracked as bug:MID-1191[])
====

The values for this parameters might be quite custom for each deployment while the verbosity of loggers which are set up and the number logged operation should be considered.

//Make sure that the logger name (`MIDPOINT_LOG`) matches the definition in the `rootLoggerAppender`.

=== Clean up the value for the attribute

There may be situation when the values need to be clean up.
The value need to be removed - not the item itself.

There are two categories of the items with the impact on the approach:

* Indexed item +
There is list of indexed attribute in the link:https://docs.evolveum.com/midpoint/reference/concepts/query/midpoint-query-language/searchable-items/[docs].
Once the item is indexed we can search and process only "affected" objects.
It has positive impact on performance in case of bigger set of the objects.
+
As an example of the item is `personalNumber` on *userType* object.
The use case could be incorrect mapping.
+
** Search for the objects to process +
To make the processing effective the filter should be used.

* Non-indexed item +
Once the item for value removal is not indexed we have to iterate over the all objects.
For each object we have to decide if the object is subject to change or not.
The easiest way how to manage it is utilizing of the script.
+
Example of the use case could be *removal of the answer for security question* in case of question decommission.
+
** known Question identifier +
We can iterate over all *userObjects* and check if the identifier is present during object processing.
If the identifier exists the delta can be applied.

** Question identifier is not known in advance +
The task should run in two phases.

*** build up the list of active security questions +
The security questions are defined in Security Policy.
We can iterate over all Security Policy objects to build up the list of the defined questions.

*** iterate over user Objects to identify invalid answers +
Once we have available list of valid question identifiers, the list can be compared with the stored answers.
If the answer for the question with unknown identifier is found, we have object to process the cleaning.
