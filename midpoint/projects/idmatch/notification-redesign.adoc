= Notification Redesign in 4.5
:page-toc: top

Jira task: bug:MID-7484[]

== Known current limitations

* No in-app notifications.
* No notification persistence.
This makes in-app notifications and retrying notifications impossible.
* Few supported transports (email and sms?)
* Missing easy to use templating with multi-language support.

== Open questions

* How to customize various templates?
* How to represent changes, e.g. deltas, in them?
* What states are necessary to support both GUI and various outbound transports?
* What types of notifications are needed for various use cases, e.g. confirmation notification, governance-related notifications, error related notifications...?
What are their specifics?
* Do we want some notification priorities?
Should it be explicit or implicit, e.g. by notification type?
* Do we want notification log?
If notifications are persisted, should that be the log as well?
* May notification be confirmed somehow?
E.g. marking them as _read_ would be possible for GUI, perhaps even for some chat-delivered notifications.
Fire and forget is obviously easier, but even there we want to be sure that it was at least sent/written somehow.
