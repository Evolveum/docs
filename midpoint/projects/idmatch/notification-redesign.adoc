= Notification Redesign in 4.5
:page-toc: top

* Jira task: bug:MID-7484[]
* Existing issues for Notification component: https://jira.evolveum.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20MID%20AND%20component%20%3D%20Notifications[search]

== High-level design notes

Currently, the *event* works only for *notification* mechanism - is this good?
Event results in multiple messages (which is the actual notification).
What if events are separate from notifications and notification mechanism is only one of possible consumers of the events?

There are other events, some perhaps too internal, but they could all be handled with the same
top-level interface with possible specific event handler subclasses.
Also, should be all event handlers synchronous?
How would asynchronous play with our operation results?
Perhaps the handlers should be fast and postpone longer actions later (e.g. sending an email).

== Known current limitations

* No in-app notifications.
* No notification persistence.
This makes in-app notifications and retrying notifications impossible.
* Few supported transports (email and sms?)
* Missing easy to use templating with multi-language support.

== DESIGN MEETING

* Event - predefined types - do we need custom event types?
** What is relation to notification hooks?

* Persistent notifications? YES.
** This also allows aggregation/digests.
** When aggregated, should the new notification be created? (Probably yes, it still has lifecycle.)
Also, can it replace previous notifications, or just somehow reference them.
* Notification per recipient or for multiple recipients? NO.
It's simpler to have notification per recipient (state/delivery management).
* If so, as what structure? (data model)
* Templates - now defined as bodyExpression (and other expressions) - how to structure it for various channels?
** Probably also separate from notification mechanism - perhaps `MessageTemplate`.
** Alternative - function library?
** IMPL IDEA: Let's start with `messageExpression` that returns `Message` (optionally with addressing info).
*** This replaces existing content expresions (body, subject) and optionally recipient expressions too.
*** Currently, expressions are evaluated per transport and transport can be used inside (conditions).
This is not necessarily the nicest solution, but flexible.
Alternatively, we need to add expression inside referencing transport element.
* Configuration redesign, e.g. for additional transports types or two transports of the same type.
** Should transport configuration be primarily in Notification configuration?
It may be useful/better to have it out of notifications and share it with reporting.
* Configuration convenience, how much we can do on UI?
* Attachments, currently file is referenced, requires OS/system administrator.
* Push vs pull notifications (query) - this is relevant for UI notifications too.
* Links from notifications (nonce?).
** If nonce is used, each recipient must have unique nonce - that is unique notification?

Notification vs message for final transport.
----
event -> (0..*) notifications -\
                                ----> (1..*) message (transport, mail)
                    report(s) -/

Notification:

* recipient
* state (read or not)
* messages*
** transport
** deliveryState

LATER:
What is Notification in Prism world? Object or Container or what?

== Open questions

* How to customize various templates?
* How to represent changes, e.g. deltas, in them?
* What notification states are necessary to support both GUI and various outbound transports?
* What types of notifications are needed for various use cases, e.g. confirmation notification, governance-related notifications, error related notifications...?
What are their specifics?
* Do we want some notification priorities?
Should it be explicit or implicit, e.g. by notification type?
* Do we want notification log?
If notifications are persisted, should that be the log as well?
* If persisted, should notification (current `Event`) be a container, an object or something else altogether?
If containers, do they belong to someone (part of other object aggregate) or are they standalone (e.g. like audit records)?
Do they belong to the recipient of the notification?
What to do when there are multiple recipients?
* May notification be confirmed somehow?
E.g. marking them as _read_ would be possible for GUI, perhaps even for some chat-delivered notifications.
Fire and forget is obviously easier, but even there we want to be sure that it was at least sent/written somehow.
* How to support other types of transport?
Can they be implemented with overlays?
* Do we want to support multiple transports of the same type, e.g. two different mail servers?
** Currently, multiple servers are supported, but only as a high-availability solution, trying one after another.
These are not really different channels with the same transport type.
* Should the template management be part of notification handler?
How should the template be structured?
Currenlty, it's a midPoint expression, but separate for subject and body - should it be somehow different?
If defined separately, are they objects?
* Where to manage binary resources, like pictures and attachments?
Are these objects or parts of the template or referenced files?
** Files have their own problems, how to distribute them, etc.
** Also, we want to stay true to Prism structures, so even if standalone, they must be at least containers and identified.
** But if identified, OID is better, so perhaps light-weight objects.
But how to access the content efficiently, isn't current `getObject` still too heavy-weight?
Do we want some light-weight get without full object, only reading OID + BLOB from a column?

== Known gaps

* Simple UI based notification administration, e.g. simple copy/paste of HTML template without the need to escape it.
** Currently, this needs to be copied to the system configuration object XML.
** xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/notifications/velocity/[Velocity templating] is already available,
which is often simpler and cleaner compared to Groovy, altough Groovy multi-line strings are also possible.
* Template override for different transport (channel) without the need to create new notification handler.
* Template management with multi-language support.
* Scoping template for org units, also different org units (or other criteria) can have different notification targets and channels.
** This is currently possible with different handlers, what is the problem with that?
Especially when different template and/or channel and/or recipient is to be used, it is already the bulk of the handler configuration.
* Attachments like pictures are necessary too.
* Quick global notification redirection, e.g. for test or debug purposes, preferably in UI.
** E.g. using file debug only instead of the real transport.
* Actionable links in the notifications, like approve/deny, ideally without any need to log in.
(Currently, password reset uses nonce for this, so there is a precedens.)

== Implementation notes

* Why are transports registering themselves?
What is the difference between `transportRegistry.registerTransport(NAME, this)` and `NotificationManagerImpl.registerTransport`
(which eventually uses the first call) usages?
* Element `handler` (under `notificationConfiguration`) is of type `EventHandlerType`, and so are many of the nested
elements, e.g. `simpleUserNotifier`.
** Reportedly, there is a kind of "pipes and filters" pattern - but is it this nesting?
There is also a xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/notifications/#special-kinds-of-handlers[handler chain],
but that one is a sequence of handlers, not nested handlers.
I guess, it doesn't make sense to nest stuff like `accountPasswordNotifier` inside each other?
In any case, auto-complete in Studio is rather a mess inside the handlers.
* What is `alsoSuccess` and how is it used?
* Remove empty `NotificationFunctions`?

=== NotificationManager method usage

* `registerTransport` is used only in `DummyTransport` (`model-test`), everything else is registered
in `notifications-impl` using `TransportRegistry#registerTransport`.
* `processEvent` without event handler type is the only method used out of tests and notifications-impl itself:
** Its only usage outside `notifications-impl` is in `NotifyExecutor` implementing `ActionExecutor.execute`, called only from `ScriptingExpressionEvaluator`.
** Usages in `notifications-impl` module are in:
*** `AccountOperationListener` implelementing `ResourceOperationListener` from `provisioning-api`
*** `EventHelper` component further used by `CertificationListener` (implementing `AccessCertificationEventListener` from `certification-api`) and `WorkflowListenerImpl` (iplementing `WorkflowListener` from `workflow-api`)
*** `NotificationHook` implementing `ChangeHook` from `model-api
*** `NotificationTaskListener` implementing `TaskListener` from `task-api`
* `processEvent` version with `EventHandlerType` is only used in the `notifications-impl` module
and only by internal classes, also called from implementation of the first `processEvent` method.
This is a questionable usage.
* Both `disabled` methods are currently used for testing only:
** `setDisabled` used only in tests in modules `model-intest`, `model-test`, `story` and `workflow-impl`
** `isDisabled` used in `model-intest` and in `notifications-impl`

Summary: Only first `processEvent` seems to be a core method, the rest is for testing only
(`disabled`, but that's OK), underused (`registerTransport`) or perhaps should be hidden (second `processEvent`).
