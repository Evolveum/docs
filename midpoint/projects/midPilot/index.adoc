:page-description: MidPilot delivers an AI assistant for rapid application onboarding to accelerate IGA integration, reduce shadow IT, and strengthen security by improving visibility and proactive identity management.


The goal of the midPilot project is to tackle challenges in the area of identity governance and administration (IGA).
This field has grown increasingly important, with around 80% of cyberattacks now targeting identity-related vulnerabilities.
One of the key issues is a weak visibility into the environment due to the slow and often incomplete onboarding of applications into centralized IGA systems.

MidPilot brings an AI assistant for rapid application onboarding.
This approach aims to accelerate IGA integration, reduce shadow IT, lower operational costs, improve identity governance, and significantly reduce the organizationâ€™s attack surface through proactive identity management across the entire infrastructure.

== Project Goals

The main goal of the midPilot is to accelerate application onboarding into midPoint, reduce reliance on manual effort, and improve overall governance and security posture.
By enabling rapid integration capabilities we aim to achieve

* reduced shadow IT,
* lowered operational costs,
* lowered implementation costs,
* improved visibility into the environment,
* improved overall security.

== Approach

As part of the project, we aim to address the key technical challenges involved in connecting systems to an identity governance and administration (IGA) platform, midPoint.
This includes the development of integration code (connectors) for different operations, such as authentication, authorization, object discovery, and identity-related operations.
Given the diversity of integration protocols, evolving system interfaces, and the need to verify behavior in live environments, building these connectors can be highly time-consuming.
Moreover, modern organizations typically use hundreds of systems making manual development impossible to scale.
Our goal is to leverage generative AI (GenAI) for connector development and maintenance and thus reduce the overall effort and time related to onboarding new applications.

In parallel, we plan to implement AI-powered tools to streamline data model mapping between systems.
Attribute names often differ due to language, format, or abbreviation inconsistencies, making manual mapping slow and error-prone.
The proposed AI-powered recommendation system will identify likely attribute matches.
In complex or non-obvious cases, the processes will be further enhanced with analyzing sample mappings, live data, or applying script-based transformations.
The process of using mapping recommender will be interactive and iterative, proposing suitable solutions that will always need a confirmation from a user.
In cases where no direct mapping is possible, for example because a native midPoint attribute is missing, the AI will propose schema extensions to support organization-specific attributes.
By combining GenAI with additional AI/ML techniques, heuristics and midPoint simulations mechanism, we aim to reduce manual effort and increase the speed and accuracy of identity data integration.

Finally, we will focus on automating correlation process.
This involves object types correlation followed by identity correlations, aligning records such as user accounts, roles, and memberships between the source system and midPoint.
Our approach will use AI to suggest delineation and correlation rules based on data analysis, common approaches, statistical and heuristic methods.
For straightforward cases, automatic correlation of the majority of records will be recommended, with manual review reserved for outliers.
In more complex scenarios, the system will support deeper analysis and allow step-by-step confirmation of correlation proposals, including simulations of the post-correlation state to support decision-making.
If no initial rules are identifiable, the process can start manually, enabling the AI system to learn from user-confirmed matches.


Throughout, the system will be designed to handle real-world data quality issues, such as typos, missing values, and inconsistencies, ensuring reliable correlation and mappings even in less-than-ideal conditions.

== Outcomes

Key outcomes of midPilot projects are following:

* Service for connector code generator
* Service for mappings and correlation recommendations
* Integration catalog
* Improved UI/UX for midPoint and midPoint Studio

=== Service for connector code generator

One of the key deliverables of the project will be a service for assisting with generating connector code.
This service will take into account detailed contextual information about both, the application to integrate and the connector framework to generate integration code for different operations, such as object and schema detection, execution of identity and access management operations, together with the possibility to help with the connector configuration options.
It will support various object types such as users, groups, organizational units, memberships, and others.
The service will be designed to cover integration with cloud services as well as on-premise applications.

=== Service for mappings and correlation recommendations

Another outcome of midPilot project will be a service providing an AI-based recommender for correlation and mappings configuration.
In both cases, the recommendation process will be interactive and iterative, with always requiring final decision to be made by the user.

The mapping recommendation part will support various mapping scenarios, from simple one-to-one attribute name translations (accounting for abbreviations or multilingual labels), to more complex mappings that involve transformations, value composition, or scripting logic, including recommendations for schema extension if no relevant attribute is found in midPoint.

The correlation recommendation service will support identification of correlation keys among objects, including identifications of the rules for linking users and their accounts, groups to role, aligning group memberships with user's assignments or matching organizational units.
Moreover, data correlation step will be included, to correctly identify different kind of objects of the same type, such as admin, employee, computer, or service accounts.

=== Integration catalog

A dedicated integration catalog will be another outcome of the project.
The purpose of the integration catalog is to enable users to browse, share, and reuse not only existing connectors, but also mapping configurations and correlation rules.

=== UI/UX Improvements

MidPoint UI/UX will be improved to support AI-assisted integration workflows.
This includes the development and integration of all the above-mentioned functionality, including new wizard for connector code generator, re-worked wizard for mapping and correlation configuration.
To support advanced midPoint users and integrators, improvements regarding generating code, model mapping suggestions, and correlation rules will be integrated directly within the midPoint Studio plugin.

== Timeline

The midPilot project will last one year, starting April, 1st and ending March 30, 2026.
We expect all the outcomes will be available in production quality in xref:/midpoint/roadmap/[midPoint 4.11 version].
Before the 4.11 is prepared for the official release, we plan to release midPont 4.11 - Preview release to make the outcomes available as an early preview.
Note: A detailed timeline of midPoint releases can be found in the xref:/midpoint/roadmap/[roadmap].
