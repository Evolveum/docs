"Organizations are people too"::
Better management of organizational units such as projects and research teams.
E.g. assign persistent identifier, make sure there is website, that proper meta-data are published, that the project/team is discoverable, record it in academic registers, project lists, etc.
Discoverability of research team may boost academic cooperation even before the team publishes any paper.
There may be interesting connections to IdM, e.g. consent of project members to be mentioned on project homepage.
Providing team _curation_ (custodianship): maintenance of team membership, metadata, keep team page up to date, prompt for description review, etc.
