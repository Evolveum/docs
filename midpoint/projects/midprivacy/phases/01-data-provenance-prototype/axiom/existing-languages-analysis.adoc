= Existing Schema language analysis

We considered several existing languages for schema modeling in the context of midPrivacy
based on our existing experience with using custom XSD annotations in *midPoint* and
implementation of *YANG* language in OpenDaylight projects.

////
|===
| Language | Pros | Cons | Notes

| XSD
| * Well-supported
a|
 * Verbose
 * Not human readable
 * Does not have common mapping to YAML, JSON
 * Language Extensions are verbose, hard to use
| Currently used in midPoint. Experience over years showed that XSD

| Topic | Java (current) | XSD (current) | YANG | SCIM | JSON Schema

a| *Syntax / Host language*

Syntax which is used to write model, eg. host language for schema.

| Java interfaces & beans
| XML
| simple C-like syntax
| JSON (possibly YAML)
| JSON (possibly YAML)

a| *Standardized serialization mapping*

Standardized serialization formats for modeling language

|
| XML
| XML, JSON, YAML
| JSON, YAML
| JSON, YAML

| *Verbosity*
| verbose
| verbose
| terse
| terse
| terse

| *Simple properties*

Property which holds simple value

| yes
| yes
| yes
| yes
| yes


| *Complex properties*

Property which holds set of other named properties

| yes
| yes
| yes
| yes
| yes

| *Named simple types*

Does language allows for custom simple type definition?
E.g. special case strings.

| yes
| yes
| yes
| no
| yes

| *Named complex types*

Does language allows for custom complex type definition? These types may have
multiple named properties.

| yes
| yes
| Partially (via grouping & maybe extension)
| no
| yes

| *Namespace support*
| yes
| yes
| yes
| yes
| no

a| *Metadata support*

Does language support metadata out of the box?
For which concepts they support metadata? Object, Property or Value

| No, needs to be explicitly modeled
| No, needs to be explicitly modeled
| Value level, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7952[YANG metadata extension]
| Object level, nested attributes needs to be modeled as complex in order to support metadata
| No, needs to be explicitly modeled.

| *Schema language extensibility*

Is language itself extensible, in order to contain additional metadata?
| yes
| yes using appInfo
| yes, using extensions
| yes, but not feasible to change the default schema
| yes, using extension keywords

| *Identity provisioning specifics*
| yes
| no, may be added using appInfo
| no, may be added using extensions
| yes, built-in basic schema
| no, may be added using extension keywords

| *Notes*
| Not really a reusable "language" per se.
| We are already using XSD, but xref:../axiom-notes/[we are not really happy with it].
| YANG is built for a different purpose (networking) and it shows.
| SCIM is specific to identity provisioning.
Which may look like an advantage.
But this is a major disadvantage.
E.g. there is hardcoded default schema that cannot really be changed.
It may be difficult to reuse for aspects that are not based on identity provisioning.
| Targeted at JSON world, which is very simplistic.
It may be difficult to add features that we need (e.g. versioning, namespaces).
