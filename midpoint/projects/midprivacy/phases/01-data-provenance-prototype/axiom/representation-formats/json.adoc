= JSON Representation Format For Axiom

== Minimal And Dangerous

This example is the very minimal JSON file.
It assumes that the processor knows the namespace of the model, model version is irrelevant (latest) and so on.

[source,json]
----
{
  "@root": "user",
  "givenName" : "John",
  "familyName" : "Doe",
  "path" : "user/myIdentifier",
  "activation" : {
    "administrativeStatus" : "enabled"
  },
  "myIdentifier" : "123",
  "employmentStatus" : "full"
}
----

There is considerable risk taken by avoiding all namespaces and prefixes.
E.g. `myIdentifier` is an item introduced by augmentation and it belongs to custom namespace.
However, there is no indication of namespaces here, therefore there is a danger of naming conflict.

== Comfortable And Safe With URIs

This is an example of JSON file with reasonable identification of the model.
Full URIs are used to make this unambiguous.

[source,json]
----
{
  "@root": "user",
  "@context" : "https://schema.evolveum.com/midpoint/common",
  "@version": "4.4",
  "givenName" : "John",
  "familyName" : "Doe",
  "path" : "user/(https://schema.example.com/custom#myIdentifier)",
  "activation" : {
    "administrativeStatus" : "enabled"
  },
  "https://schema.example.com/custom#myIdentifier" : "123",
  "https://schema.example.com/custom#employmentStatus" : "full"
}
----

This example is unambiguous, the data are written in reliable way, there are no naming conflicts.
Primary model and version is precisely identified, including model version.
However, the custom augmentation model is identified only by namespace, the version is not indicated.

TODO: how to specify model version? Is that `@version` OK? How about Prism version?

Alternative namespace format:

[source,json]
----
{
  "@root": "user",
  "@context" : "https://schema.evolveum.com/midpoint/common",
  "@version": "4.4",
  "givenName" : "John",
  "familyName" : "Doe",
  "path" : "user/(https://schema.example.com/custom#myIdentifier)",
  "activation" : {
    "administrativeStatus" : "enabled"
  },
  "https://schema.example.com/custom" : {
    "myIdentifier" : "123",
    "employmentStatus" : "full"
  }
}
----


== Comfortable And Safe With Prefixes

This is an example of JSON file with reasonable identification of the model.
Namespace prefixes are used to make this unambiguous.

[source,json]
----
{
  "@root": "user",
  "@context" : "https://schema.evolveum.com/midpoint/common",
  "@version": "4.4",
  "@ns:example-custom" : "https://schema.example.com/custom",
  "givenName" : "John",
  "familyName" : "Doe",
  "path" : "user/example-custom:myIdentifier",
  "activation" : {
    "administrativeStatus" : "enabled"
  },
  "example-custom:myIdentifier" : "123",
  "example-custom:employmentStatus" : "full"
}
----

This example is unambiguous, the data are written in reliable way, there are no naming conflicts.
Primary model and version is precisely identified, including model version.
However, the custom augmentation model is identified only by namespace, the version is not indicated.

TODO: how to specify model version? Is that `@version` OK? How about Prism version?


== Undeclared Prefixes

Use of XML prefixes without a need to declare them.
Mapping of prefixes to namespace URLs is taken from model definitions.
Model namespace and version is assumed.

[source,json]
----
{
  "@root": "user",
  "givenName" : "John",
  "familyName" : "Doe",
  "path" : "user/example-custom:myIdentifier",
  "activation" : {
    "administrativeStatus" : "enabled"
  },
  "example-custom:myIdentifier" : "123",
  "example-custom:employmentStatus" : "full"
}
----

This is a terse format suitable for example for database storage.
Model namespace could be hardcoded, model version is likely to be same for the entire database, therefore it can stored in one place.
We still want to use prefixes to be able to reliably distinguish augmentations.
But we want to avoid repetitive declaration of the prefixes.

== Full Regalia With URIs - Portable Format

This is an example of JSON with complete and strict data about model, strict namespace declarations and so on.

[source,json]
----
{
  "@root": "user",
  "@context" : "https://schema.evolveum.com/midpoint/common",
  "@version": "4.4",
  "givenName" : "John",
  "familyName" : "Doe",
  "path" : "user/(https://schema.example.com/custom#myIdentifier)",
  "activation" : {
    "administrativeStatus" : "enabled"
  },
  "https://schema.example.com/custom#myIdentifier" : "123"
}
----

{

  },
  "example-custom:myIdentifier" : "123",
  "example-custom:employmentStatus" : "full"
}
----

TODO: how to identify custom model version?

== Root item

Canonical way how to specify a root item is to use `@root` clause:

[source,json]
----
{
  "@root": "user",
  "givenName" : "John",
  "familyName" : "Doe",
  "path" : "user/myIdentifier",
  "activation" : {
    "administrativeStatus" : "enabled"
  },
  "myIdentifier" : "123",
  "employmentStatus" : "full"
}
----

Alternatively, the document may be formed as a single-key object (map):

[source,json]
----
{
  "user" : {
      "givenName" : "John",
      "familyName" : "Doe",
      "path" : "user/myIdentifier",
      "activation" : {
        "administrativeStatus" : "enabled"
      },
      "myIdentifier" : "123",
      "employmentStatus" : "full"
  }
}
----


== Compatibility

This is an example of format variation that were used in the past, but we still want to be able to parse them.

There is an old namespace for the `midpoint` model, which is configured as an namespace alias for the model.

=== Extension Element

Augmentation items are placed in dedicated `extension` key.
This key is explicitly specified in the midpoint or prism object definition to be used for compatibility purposes.

[source,json]
----
{
  "@root": "user",
  "@context" : "https://schema.evolveum.com/midpoint/common",
  "@version": "4.4",
  "@ns:example-custom" : "https://schema.example.com/custom",
  "givenName" : "John",
  "familyName" : "Doe",
  "path" : "user/example-custom:myIdentifier",
  "activation" : {
    "administrativeStatus" : "enabled"
  },
  "extension" : {
      "example-custom:myIdentifier" : "123",
      "example-custom:employmentStatus" : "full"
  }
}
----

Even though there is additional element `extension`, the item path is still expressed without that element.
E.g the path for employmentStatus should be:

[source,axiom-path]
----
example-custom:employmentStatus
----

Axiom data processors can still accept paths with `extension` element for compatibility reasons, such as:

[source,axiom-path]
----
extension/example-custom:employmentStatus
----

However, such path is not considered to be canonical.
The path should be transformed to a form without the `extension` element whenever possible.

=== Namespaces With @ns

Namespace for all keys within an object (map) can be set by special `@ns` keyword:

[source,json]
----
{
  "@ns" : "https://schema.evolveum.com/midpoint/common",
  "user" : {
      "givenName" : "John",
      "familyName" : "Doe",
      "path" : "user/myIdentifier",
      "activation" : {
        "administrativeStatus" : "enabled"
      },
      "extension" : {
          "@ns" : "https://schema.example.com/custom",
          "myIdentifier" : "123",
          "employmentStatus" : "full"
      }
  }
}
----

== Metadata

Metadata for simple string item (`givenName`) and for structured item (`actiavtion`).

[source,json]
----
{
  "@root": "user",
  "@context" : "https://schema.evolveum.com/midpoint/common",
  "givenName" : {
    "@value" : "John",
    "@metadata" : {
      "storage" : {
        "creation" : {
          "timestamp" : "2020-06-12T18:14:05Z"
        }
      },
      "https://schema.example.com/custom#verification" : {
        "level" : "verified",
        "verifier" : "jack"
      }
    }
  },
  "activation" : {
    "@value" : {
      "administrativeStatus" : {
        "@value" : "enabled",
        "@metadata" : {
          "storage" : { ... }
        }
      }
    },
    "@metadata" : {
      "storage" : { ... }
    }
  },
  ...
}
----

Storage metadata are specified in midPoint model, therefore `storage` item does not need to be namespace-qualified.

Multivalue string item with metadata:

[source,json]
----
{
  "@root": "user",
  "@context" : "https://schema.evolveum.com/midpoint/common",
  ...
  "foo" :
    [
      {
        "@value" : "One",
        "@metadata" : { ... }
      },
      {
        "@value" : "Two",
        "@metadata" : { ... }
      },
      {
        "@value" : "Three",
        "@metadata" : { ... }
      }
    ]
  ...
}
----
