The following terms are used in Axiom:

model:: Axiom model defines set of type, item, value and metadata definitions.
Model is a basic "packaging" mechanism for Axiom definitions.

schema:: Set of one or several models that are used together.
Schema is usually set of models that are loaded and active in an application.
Schema is a "soft" concept, it is not formally defined anywhere in Axiom definitions.

item:: Data item which can have one or more values. It is identified by item name.

item name:: Name of data item. Item name can be local (if item is native to the data type) or fully qualified name (if item is external/ augmented to the data type).

type:: Represents a type of value. It can be _simple type_ or _structured type_, and may its instance (value) may have _value metadata_ attached.

simple type:: A type, which has simple value (eg. integer, string), does not have nested items.

structured type:: A type, which has structured value - value consisting of multiple named items.

value:: Represents concrete instance of type. The value is instance of _type_ and may have _value metadata_ attached.

metadata:: Data about data. Metadata may describe origin of the data, trustworthiness and so on.

value metadata:: Represents metadata attached to value.
Each individual value of an item may have different metadata.

augmentation:: Mechanism for declaring additional items to already defined objects.

representation format:: (also _serialization format_)
Specific data format used to store the data.
JSON, XML and YAML are examples of representation formats.
