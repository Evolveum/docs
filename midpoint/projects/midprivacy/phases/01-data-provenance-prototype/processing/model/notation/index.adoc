= Notation used

[[definitions]]If X is an xref:../comparing-values/[equivalence strategy], a and b are values, and A and B are sets of values, then:

[cols="1a,2a,2a"]
|===
| Notation | Definition | Description/Note
| a &Tilde;~X~ b
| a and b are equivalent under strategy X
| We also call them X-equivalent.

| a &in;~X~ B
| &exist;b&in;B: a&Tilde;~X~b
| Value a is present in B (under X)

| a &notin;~X~ B
| &not;(a&in;~X~B) ⇔ &not;&exist;b&in;B: a&Tilde;~X~b
| Value a is not present in B (under X)

| A &cap;~X~ B
| { a&in;A \| a &in;~X~ B }
| Intersection of A and B under X. footnote:[We could try to define A&cap;~X~B also as { a \| a&in;~X~A &and; a&in;~X~B }
but this is not quite correct. Such definition would result in infinite set of values, because there are many values that are
X-equivalent with any given value. So the set of candidate values must be somehow bound.]footnote:[This also means that &cap;~X~
operation is _not_ commutative! In general, A &cap;~X~ B can be different from B &cap;~X~ A.]

| A -~X~ B
| { a&in;A \| a &notin;~X~ B }
| Set difference under X.

[[definition-del]]
When applying delete xref:../delta/[deltas], a special relation and set operation have to be defined:

[cols="1a,2a,2a"]
|===
| Notation | Definition | Description/Note
| a &Tilde;~del/X~ b
| a~id~ = b~id~ ≠ null &or; a &Tilde;~X~ b
| Value a matches deletion pattern b (under X).

| A -~del/X~ B
| A - { a&in;A \| &exist;b&in;B such that a &Tilde;~del~ b }
| Result of application of deletion patterns in B to set A (under X).
|===

The a~id~ denotes ID of prism container value a (or null if a is not a prism container value).
