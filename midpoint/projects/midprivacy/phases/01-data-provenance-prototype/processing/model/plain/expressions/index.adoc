= Processing expressions

See xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/expressions/[Expression] for background information.

An _expression evaluator_ converts _sources_ and _input variables_ to _output values_ under given _evaluation parameters_.

Sources, input variables, and output values are usually _relativistic_ in the sense that they do not only comprise actual values,
but _changes of values_ from their _old_ to _new_ states.

There are various kinds of expression evaluators, for example script-based evaluators, `asIs` evaluator, `literal` evaluator,
`generate` evaluator, and so on. We concentrate on basic principles of expression evaluation first, and only after that
we will describe individual evaluators' features.

Item-delta-item and delta set triple structures are described in article on
xref:../../change-representation/[change representation] (and its
xref:../../change-representation-with-metadata/[metadata-aware version]).

=== Evaluation parameters

TIP: You can skip reading about evaluation parameters at first.

There are two kinds of evaluation parameters: static (specified as part of expression definition in `ExpressionType`)
or dynamic (provided to expression evaluator at run time).

==== Parameters for all evaluators

===== Static parameters
The following are contained in `ExpressionType` bean.

====== Evaluator(s) definition
This definition specifies the required processing. For example, a script that should be executed, a constant value that
is to be the output of the expression evaluation, and so on.

[cols="2,8a"]
|===
| Overview | Definition of expression evaluator(s)
| Type | An element that can substitute `c:expressionEvaluator`
| Structure | Specific for each evaluator definition. See e.g. `ScriptExpressionEvaluatorType`,
`AssignmentTargetSearchExpressionEvaluatorType`, and so on.
| Multiplicity | Exactly one, except for default `asIs` (can be omitted) or `value` evaluator (can be more of them).
|===

====== Other parameters

[%header]
[cols="2,8a"]
|===
| Parameter | Meaning
| `allowEmptyValues` | TODO
| `queryInterpretationOfNoValue` | TODO
| `returnMultiplicity` (`single` or `multi`) | TODO
| `variable` (multi)
| Additional variables that will be available to expression evaluator. These can obtain either:

* constant string value,
* constant object value (specified by providing object reference, currently limited to type+OID only),
* path (referencing an item in an existing variable or source).
|===

====== Auxiliary and unused parameters
Just for completeness let's mention here parameters that have no effect on the computation at this
level of abstraction or are not implemented at all.

[%header]
[cols="2,8a"]
|===
| Parameter | Meaning
| `runAsRef` | Under what principal should the expression be evaluated.
| `stringFilter` | Unused.
| `parameter` and `returnType` | Currently not used for evaluation in most cases. Their use is currently
limited to custom function libraries.
| `extension` | Currently not used.
| `trace` | Records evaluation information to the log.
| `name`, `description`, `documentation` | For documentation purposes.
|===

====== Dynamic (run-time) evaluation parameters

NOTE: The following parameters are formally available to all evaluators but in fact interpreted only for value-transformation ones.

[%header]
[cols="2,8"]
|===
| Parameter | Meaning
| skipEvaluationPlus | Should we skip evaluation for values that would go to "plus" output set?
| skipEvaluationMinus | Should we skip evaluation for values that would go to "minus" output set?
|===

==== Parameters for value-transformation evaluators

These parameters are statically defined in `TransformExpressionEvaluatorType`. Their meaning is to be understood
in the context of value-transformation evaluation algorithm.

[%header]
[cols="2,8"]
|===
| Parameter | Meaning
| relativityMode | Selects between absolute and relative ("combinatorial") mode of evaluation.
| includeNullInputs | Whether null inputs should be taken into account. TODO

== Evaluators ==
Currently, supported evaluators are:
[%header]
[cols="10,20,5,50"]
|===
| Evaluator | Implementation | Type | Description

| `value` | `LiteralExpressionEvaluator` | Z |
Returns zero set with literal value (values) specified in the evaluator. Plus and minus sets are empty.

| `path` | `PathExpressionEvaluator` | D |
Returns delta set triple derived from specified source (or default source) by resolving specified path.

| `asIs` | `AsIsExpressionEvaluator` | D |
Returns delta set triple of the default source. (The same behavior as `path` with empty path.)

| `const` | `ConstExpressionEvaluator` | Z |
Returns zero set with a single value obtained by resolving given link:https://wiki.evolveum.com/display/midPoint/Constants[constant].
Currently limited to single-valued string constants. Plus and minus sets are empty.

| `script` | `ScriptExpressionEvaluator` | VT |
Executes specified script written e.g. in Groovy, JavaScript, Python, etc. Velocity template language is supported as well.

| `assignmentTargetSearch` | `AssignmentTargetSearchExpressionEvaluator` | VT |
Creates an assignment (or assignments) based on specified conditions for the assignment target. Can create target objects on demand.

| `associationTargetSearch` | AssociationTargetSearchExpressionEvaluator | VT |
Creates an association (or associations) based on specified condition for the associated object.

| `referenceSearch` | `ReferenceSearchExpressionEvaluator` | VT |
Creates a generic reference (or references) based on specified condition for the referenced object. (It seems to be not much used.)

| `associationFromLink` | `AssociationFromLinkExpressionEvaluator` | Z |
Creates an association (or associations) based on projections of given abstract role. I.e. a role has projection (e.g. group),
and it also induces a construction of a user account. Using this expression evaluator the account can obtain groups
that are projections of that particular role. To be used in mappings in induced constructions only i.e. not in template
mappings or assigned focus mappings! Puts all the values into zero set. Plus and minus sets are empty.

| `generate` | `GenerateExpressionEvaluator` | Z |
Generates a string value based on given value policy. Puts it into zero set. Plus and minus sets are empty.

| `function` | `FunctionExpressionEvaluator` | Z/D |
Calls specified custom function expression. It is something like a macro: Arguments for the function call (expressions themselves)
are evaluated into delta set triples. Non-negative values from these triples become additional (zero-only) sources for the
function expression. (This is a bit questionable.) Then the function expression is evaluated, and the output triple is returned
as an output triple for the whole function expression evaluation.

| `sequentialValue` | `SequentialValueExpressionEvaluator` | Z |
Returns current value of a given sequence object. The value is returned in the zero set. Plus and minus sets are empty.
The value for a given sequence OID is stored in the model context, so it is returned each time this evaluator (with given
sequence OID) is invoked.

| `proportional` | `ProportionalExpressionEvaluator` | Z |
Experimental evaluator to be used in dashboards, maybe reports. Formats number of actual items compared with the number
of all items using specified style (percentage, "x of y", "x/y", etc). Produces single string value in the zero set.
Plus and minus sets are empty.
|===

Evaluator types regarding value relativity:
[%header]
[cols="1,10"]
|===
| Type | Meaning
| Z | Non-relativistic evaluator. All values are returned in the zero set. Plus and minus sets are empty.
| D | Direct mapping of plus/minus/zero sets from sources to outputs, with no specific treatment.
The `path` and `asIs` evaluators derive plus/minus/zero values directly from plus/minus/zero values
of a selected source. Categorization of `function` evaluator is not quite clear.
| VT | Value-transforming evaluator. See below.
|===
== Evaluation algorithms
Algorithms for `Z` (non-relativistic) and `D` (direct delta set mapping) are specific for individual evaluators.
They are sketched out in the table above. (And could be described in more details, if needed.)

What is interesting is the value-transformation algorithm used for `script` evaluator and "object search" ones
(`assignmentTargetSearch`, `associationTargetSearch` and `referenceSearch`).

=== Value-transformation algorithm
Let us describe value-transformation algorithm here. We will use `script` evaluator as an example.

A typical script evaluator configuration looks like this:

```
<script>
    <code>givenName + ' ' + familyName</code>
</script>
```

The interpretation is quite obvious: The evaluator expects two sources (let's forget about variables for the moment) -
`givenName` and `familyName`. The output of the evaluator is a concatenation of the two, probably to be stored in
the `fullName` property.

For instance, if the source values would be `Jack` and `Sparrow`, the result would be:

[cols="2,6"]
|===
2+| Sources
| givenName | `"Jack"`
| familyName | `"Sparrow"`
2+| Output
| fullName | `"Jack Sparrow"`
|===

==== Absolute vs. relative evaluation mode ====

Now let's take less obvious - although a bit artificial - example:

```
<script>
    <code>
        String.valueOf(organization)
    </code>
</script>
```

This evaluator expects `organization` source and provides its string representation. The organization is multi-valued
property, though. So what should the script expect to receive in the `organization` variable?

It depends. The script can be evaluated in one of two modes. The nomenclature is not stable yet, but let's call these modes
_absolute_ (single-shot) and _relative_ (combinatorial). These are the values of `relativityMode` evaluation parameter.

Absolute evaluation mode provides all the values of all sources to the script _at once_. So, in this case, the script
should expect that `organization` will be a collection of values e.g. `org1`, `org2`, `org3`. It will then provide a result
of `"[org1, org2, org3]"` (if the collection was a list, which is currently the case).

Relative evaluation mode provides the values of the sources to the script _one after another_. In this case the script would
be invoked three times, once for `org1`, then for `org2` and `org3`, respectively. The output would be a set of values
consisting of strings `"org1"`, `"org2"`, and `"org3"`.

[cols="2,6"]
|===
2+| Sources
| organization | `"org1"`, `"org2"`, `"org3"`
2+| Output
| (in absolute mode) | `"[org1, org2, org3]"`
| (in relative mode) | `"org1"`, `"org2"`, `"org3"`
|===

NOTE: The concept of relative and absolute evaluation is described (in more user-oriented way) also in
xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/#handling-multiple-values[Handling Multiple Values]
and xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/#absolute-script-evaluation-mode[Absolute Script Evaluation Mode]
sections on Mapping page.

What if there are more than one source?

In the absolute mode the situation is the same as in single-source case. The script simply gets individual sources as
collection-typed variables.

However, in the relative mode the script will be invoked once for each _combination_ of values
from individual sources. For example, if we have a script like this:

```
<script>
    <code>
        String.valueOf(organization) + ':' + String.valueOf(organizationalUnit)
    </code>
</script>
```

and the source values are `ACME` and `Example` for `organization` and `Sales` and `Engineering` for `organizationalUnit` then
the output will be:

[cols="2,6"]
|===
2+| Sources
| organization | `"ACME"`, `"Example"`
| organizationalUnit | `"Sales"`, `"Engineering"`
2+| Output
| (in absolute mode) | `"[ACME, Example]:[Sales, Engineering]"`
| (in relative mode) | `"ACME:Sales"`, `"ACME:Engineering"`, `"Example:Sales"`, `"Example:Engineering"`
|===

You can check for yourself using the following setup in the Mapping playground (requires enabling experimental features for GUI):

Mapping:
```
<mapping>
	<source>
		<path>organization</path>
	</source>
	<source>
		<path>organizationalUnit</path>
	</source>
	<expression>
		<script>
		   <relativityMode>relative</relativityMode>
			<code>
				String.valueOf(organization) + ':' + String.valueOf(organizationalUnit)
			</code>
		</script>
	</expression>
	<target>
		<path>description</path> <!-- ignoring the fact that description is single-valued -->
	</target>
</mapping>
```

Mapping request:
```
<mappingExecutionRequest>
	<sourceContext>
		<user>
			<organization>ACME</organization>
			<organization>Example</organization>
			<organizationalUnit>Sales</organizationalUnit>
			<organizationalUnit>Engineering</organizationalUnit>
		</user>
	</sourceContext>
</mappingExecutionRequest>
```

==== And now for some relativity ====

Things look great. Remember, though, that evaluation source is _not_ a simple set of values. It is item-delta-item,
i.e. old value, delta, and the new value. Also, the output is delta set triple (plus, minus, zero).

For example, in the following situation, what should be the output in absolute mode? And in relative mode?

[cols="2,8"]
|===
2+| Sources (item-delta-item)
| organization | `"ACME"`, `"Example"` -> `"ACME"`, `"ExAmPLE"`
| organizationalUnit | `"Sales"`, `"Engineering"` -> `"Management"`, `"Engineering"`
2+| Output delta set triple
| (in absolute mode) | plus: `?`, minus: `?`, zero: `?`
| (in relative mode) | plus: `?`, minus: `?`, zero: `?`
|===

Or, to begin with something simpler:

[cols="2,8"]
|===
2+| Sources (item-delta-item)
| givenName | `"Jack"` -> `"JACK"`
| familyName | `"Sparrow"`
2+| Output delta set triple
| fullName | plus: `?`, minus: `?`, zero: `?`
|===

[cols="2,8"]
|===
2+| Sources (item-delta-item)
| organization | `"org1"`, `"org2"`, `"org3"` -> `"org1"`, `"org2"`
2+| Output delta set triple
| (in absolute mode) | plus: `?`, minus: `?`, zero: `?`
| (in relative mode) | plus: `?`, minus: `?`, zero: `?`
|===

How is the output delta set triple computed:

1. We assume that target item (i.e. item that will contain result of the computation) in "old" state has
values corresponding to sources in their "old" state. (That might or might not be true. But it's a reasonable
assumption we work with.)

2. Therefore, the output delta set triple should be such that

 * assuming the target item contains values corresponding to sources in their "old" state,
 * after the application of output delta set triple to the target item it will contain values corresponding
to sources in their "new" state.

See also the link:formal/[expression evaluation model].

Knowing this, the expected output for the above scenarios is quite straightforward:

[cols="2,8a"]
|===
2+| Sources (item-delta-item)
| givenName | `"Jack"` -> `"JACK"`
| familyName | `"Sparrow"`
2+| Output delta set triple computation
| Output in old state | `"Jack Sparrow"`
| Output in new state | `"JACK Sparrow"`
| The difference |
* plus: `"JACK Sparrow"`
* minus: `"Jack Sparrow"`
* zero: nothing
|===

[cols="2,8a"]
|===
2+| Sources (item-delta-item)
| organization | `"org1"`, `"org2"`, `"org3"` -> `"org1"`, `"org2"`
2+| Output delta set triple computation (absolute mode)
| Output in old state | `"[org1, org2, org3]"`
| Output in new state | `"[org1, org2]"`
| The difference |
* plus: `"[org1, org2]"`
* minus: `"[org1, org2, org3]"`
* zero: nothing
2+| Output delta set triple computation (relative mode)
| Output in old state | `"org1"`, `"org2"`, `"org3"`
| Output in new state | `"org1"`, `"org2"`
| The difference |
* plus: nothing
* minus: `"org3"`
* zero: `"org1"`, `"org2"`
|===

| organizationalUnit | `"Sales"`, `"Engineering"` -> `"Management"`, `"Engineering"`
2+| Output delta set triple computation (absolute mode)
| Output in old state | `"[ACME, Example]:[Sales, Engineering]"`
| Output in new state | `"[ACME, ExAmPLE]:[Management, Engineering]"`
| The difference |
* plus: `"[ACME, ExAmPLE]:[Management, Engineering]"`
* minus: `"[ACME, Example]:[Sales, Engineering]"`
* zero: nothing
2+| Output delta set triple computation (relative mode)
| Output in old state |
* `"ACME:Sales"`
* `"ACME:Engineering"`
* `"Example:Sales"`
* `"Example:Engineering"`
| Output in new state |
* `"ACME:Management"`
* `"ACME:Engineering"`
* `"ExAmPLE:Management"`
* `"ExAmPLE:Engineering"`
| The difference |
* plus: `"ACME:Management"`, `"ExAmPLE:Management"`, `"ExAmPLE:Engineering"`
* minus: `"ACME:Sales"`, `"Example:Sales"`, `"Example:Engineering"`

==== Implementation information

===== Implementation for absolute (single-shot) mode

The implementation for absolute mode follows the specification quite closely.

1. First, it determines whether we need to evaluate both old and new modes:
it looks if any of the sources or variables contain a delta.
2. If there is no delta, the computation of `O'` is carried out for new state
and results are put into `O~zero~`. (See also the link:formal/[evaluation model].)
3. If there is a delta, the computation of both `O` and `O'` is carried out,
and the delta set is computed according to the spec:
* O~plus~ = O' - O
* O~minus~ = O - O'
* O~zero~ = O ∩ O'

The absolute mode computation is invoked if `relativityMode` is `absolute` or if there are no sources.

===== Implementation for relative (combinatorial) mode

The implementation for relative mode works currently like this.

1. *Compute source triples.* Transform each source into source value triple i.e. plus/minus/zero sets.
Add `null` values if necessary.footnote:[This is to ensure at least one execution in "plus" and in "minus" evaluation mode.
See `CombinatorialEvaluation.addFakeNullValues`.] Put source triples into a list,
in the same order as the sources have.

2. *Process all combinations* of values in respective source value sets so that the following will hold:
* O~plus~ = results of transforming combinations of values from non-negative source values sets except for all-zero sourced values
* O~minus~ = results of transforming combinations of values from non-positive source values sets except for all-zero sourced values
* O~zero~ = results of transforming combinations of values from zero source values sets

Processing of combinations works like this:

A. Compute 'sets occupied' information: for each source we determine the sets (plus, minus, zero) that this source
has. We put this information to two lists: `setsOccupiedPlusZero` for plus/zero sets and `setsOccupiedMinusZero`
for minus/zero sets. These two lists will be used to generated value tuples later.

B. Generate values for plus and zero output sets:
* In the first step, select a combination of "source sets" (plus vs. zero) that will provide input values for individual
sources. For example (having 4 sources), we select "plus - plus - zero - plus", meaning that input values for sources 1, 2, 4
will be selected from their plus sets, and input value for source 3 will be selected from its zero set.
* Having specific source sets we now take all value combinations from the respective sets. (This is done by
`transform(sets, outputSet)` method.)
- If all source sets are zero, then output set is also zero.
- Otherwise (i.e. if any of the source sets is plus), then output set is plus.

C. Generate values for minus set:
* Similarly to above, select a combination of "source sets" (minus vs. zero) that will provide input values for individual
sources. For example (having 4 sources), we select "zero - minus - minus - zero", meaning that input values for sources 2 and 3
will be selected from their minus sets, and input values for sources 1 and 4 will be selected from their zero set.
* Having specific source sets we now take all value combinations from the respective sets. We skip the evaluation
when all sets are zero, because it was already done above. So at least one input set must be minus. Outputs of the
evaluation go to the minus set.

Note that when evaluating, we add values from input variables to the variables being prepared for the invocation
of the condition and of the transformational function. For relational variables we use old/new versions, depending on
the target set (zero, plus - we use new, minus - we use old). For non-relational variables we use the value as is.

Then, we transform the tuple (i.e. compute output values):

* If condition is present, we first evaluate the condition (on prepared variables).
If it evaluates to false, the result of the transformation is considered to be an empty set.

* If condition is non-present or true, we transform the tuple by calling the transformational
function (on prepared variables).

And finally, we put the result of the transformation (zero, one, or more values) to
the appropriate target set (plus, minus, zero).
