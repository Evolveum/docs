= Repository Design
:page-toc: top

[NOTE]
This page is part of MidScale project documentation and was freezed at the end of the project.
See xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/native-postgresql/design-and-implementation.adoc[Design and Implementation]
and xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/native-postgresql/db-maintenance.adoc[DB maintenance] for current pages.

== Basic considerations

* Capacity
** Goal to support up to 20M users around end of 2021 (e.g. now 8M, growing around 300K monthly).

* Is PostgreSQL enough from business perspective? What about Oracle?
** If it's optimized for PG, tests must be run against PG as well, H2 will not cover the new repo at all.
** Primary goal is PG, but let's not close the door for Oracle too soon.

== Initial design assumptions

* Focus on PostgreSQL only, without necessarily making Oracle usage impossible.
* New repository will be SQL/JDBC based with http://www.querydsl.com/[Querydsl library] used for
dynamic query construction.
No Hibernate, ORM, JPA will be used.
https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html[Unit of work pattern] will not be utilized.
Reasons are:
** We need more control over query construction without switching between HQL (or JPQL) and native SQL.
** We need dynamic columns for extensions or audit custom attributes.
This is generally impossible with JPA/ORM solutions.
(Alternatively we can use JSONB type in PostgreSQL.)
** Unit of work pattern (Hibernate "session" or JPA "persistence context") is not beneficial for
a repository clearly separated from midPoint model.
There is no direct mapping of object model to the repository, repository is more operation oriented,
even though the opreations are generic and may resemble typical "ORM repository" operations.
** Each repository operation is transaction on its own.
This is another reason why "unit of work" is meaningless in midPoint.
** Without "unit of work" repository should be more memory efficient (no implicitly held data in session)
and CPU efficient (no dirty checking, all modifications will be explicit).
* We will start with DB objects close to existing repository, but
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-inherit.html[table inheritance] will be used for `m_object`
and related tables.
* Because `m_shadow` is also object and declarative paritioning can't be combined with inheritance,
we will use "application managed partitioning" (implemented with inherited tables) for `m_shadow`
if the data volume requires it.

== Database schema

* Current DB schema problems:
** `M_OBJECT` is too heavy (full object?)
** `M_SHADOW` table is too big (10-20 times `M_USER` size), talk 200M expected soon.
Indexes are not enough, little variance in data (resource, object class, kind, intent).
*But inherited table cannot be partitioned* resulting in error: `[42P17] ERROR: cannot create partitioned table as inheritance child`
We will use inheritance for application-managed shadow partitioning.
Open question is how to do custom shadow attributes, if primary/secondary/tertiary ID is good enough
solution we can forgo extension attributes (or use JSON indexes).
*** Unique OID across table hierarchy can be solved http://blog.ioguix.net/postgresql/2015/02/05/Partitionning-and-constraints-part-1.html[by triggers]
or separate OID-pool table - the latter was used for reasons described lower in the *Explored alternatives* section.
** `M_REFERENCE` can be too big (goal >100M), can be split by `REFERENCE_TYPE` which is always used for the query.

* Scalability, table hierarchy, relations:
** Separate oid table for all objects - yes, this is used to keep OID unique index on a single place.
This is, however, not the part of an `m_object` hierarchy and can be completely ignored even by the application.
** `full_object` LOB will always be placed in concrete tables (even if defined in "abstract" table).
Old-repo solution with `full_object` on a single table causes heavy contention on `M_OBJECT`.
** What about search for supertype (like any focus with some attribute equals to...)?
Examples: Searching all members of a role (assignment holder).
Unsure how critical the performance is, optimizations possible for specific queries.
It seems table inheritance would be a solution here (this may close the door https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17512871/how-to-create-inherited-table-in-oracle[for Oracle]).
** But what about associations, e.g. assignments?
We don't want to model them n-times for various types (we already don't).
Can they reference all-objects table for referential integrity?
Only owner side (currently `OWNER_OID`), but it's not possible to enforce FK to target (`TARGETREF_TARGETOID`).
Owner can have reference/assignment to non-existing target.

* What about task repository/manager?
** No changes expected at this moment.
Replacing core repository should not have impact on `task-quartz-impl` module.
** But improvements in bucket selection are welcome, there is big contention.

* Uniqueness - of names but also other attributes, often depending on other attributes.
** E.g. username is normally unique, but we may need to change it to name+tenantId (deployment specific).
** Should midPoint self-managed indexes and constraints (perhaps in 5.0 or later)?
** What before that? Separate part of schema that can be customized (various options, some commented)?

== Extension attributes, DB schema extensions

* Extensions:
** Currently, both single- and multi-values stored in tables (per data type), multi-values as multiple lines.
*** There are separate sets of tables for "object extensions" and "assignment extensions".
** Possible solution:
*** Single valued extensions directly in the owning table.
*** Multi values in separate tables created on demand for each extension attribute.
Can indexable JSON array be solution?
** Shadow is a bit different, there are various attributes depending on resource schema.
Normally we don't cache attributes, in that case there is no problem, but what if we want to?
There are still identifiers, primary is in `M_SHADOW`, we don't have secondary/tertiary.
Problem also describe on the xref:/midpoint/devel/design/identifier-theory/[Identifier Theory page].
** xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/roles/rbac/[Parametric roles]
can/will contain definition of extended attributes, how to apply these to DB schema?
*** Assignment parameters are more like "shadow attributes" while schema extensions are global.
** Ability to apply necessary DB schema changes without the restart would be nice,
but reportedly not critical depending on the needed development effort.
*** DB part of this is perhaps easier than the refresh of Prism schemas...?
*** How to distribute new column information (or any change) across the cluster?
If DB has a new column and runtime mapping doesn't, what happens? Or the other way around.
** Audit custom properties (officially experimental) replace with schema extensions.
*** Also consider `MAuditPropertyValue` what it is and why is it needed.
Unify if possible - which is very likely.

[NOTE]
Larger-than-long numeric types are stored as `String` extensions (`RAnyConverter#getAggregatedRepoObject`)
which makes direct comparison operations on them meaningless.
Conversion must be used first which is inefficient without additional function based indexes.

== Query execution performance

* Partial queries of objects without `FULL_OBJECT`, no LOB, no parsing:
** E.g. for some UI views or REST "return users only with names and..." (other data from columns).
See `GetOperationOptions` and `RetrieveOption` for existing mechanism.
** How to map it into schema types?
How to indicate the object is not complete?
** Performance of `getObject` must not get worse.
This one already uses a single select and just two columns (`OID` and `FULL_OBJECT`).

* Audit performance considerations:
** Time partitions first, then we'll see.
*** OPTIONAL: Consider alternative of old audit archival without search options.
Detaching partitions is another option, if the data can stay in the same DB.
Or we don't solve it at all and it's left to DB admin.
** An asynchronous audit - optional, per node, no cluster-wide microservice.
*** Point of audit should be still able to work like today (synchronous audit).
*** Additionally, if async-audit is on it queues the audit event.
*** Consumer batches the inserts.
*** What if audit query is executed? Should it trigger the flush operation first?
** How to change audit custom columns during existence of old partitions?
We probably don't want to solve this now and it will probably require manual DB admin intervention.
** Audit schema type currently does not contain DB primary key (serial).
This limits scenario search + go to detail later, unless we use different "ID" like `eventIdentifier`.
It seems we want to align the schema type with the repository identifier.
Drawbacks: No way to distribute ID creation, but we accept this.

== DB schema auto-management

* Objects to manage:
** Custom indexes - for extension columns.
** Custom constraints (likely experimental) - uniqueness customizations.
In 4.4 this still can be done manually, but the option must be there - separation of customizable
constraints in SQL file? See notes at uniqueness above.
*What if it collides with default index?*
** Custom tables - for to-many extensions, unless JSON can solve this.
*** OPTIONAL: Dynamic table creation can be also needed for shadow attributes (per resource).
If additional identifier columns cover the search cases, we don't want this at all.
*** UNWANTED: Possibly, this can also be used for assignments (per dynamic role?) or other objects
(archetypes with dynamic schema extensions).

* DB schema management capabilities:
** What if MP will not be allowed to alter tables?
If not what will create the columns conveniently yet safely (no typos, indexes when necessary)?
Ninja or MP can fail on start if it can't create missing stuff, ideally all things, not just the first one.
Admin can then see the log (or Ninja output) and act accordingly.

* DB schema creation and upgrade between versions.
** Cration can be done with SQL file execution for a fresh DB.
** Schema still needs to be examined for custom columns (extensions) anyway.
** Update between versions should be effortless, e.g. execution of `+*-upgrade-*.sql+`.

== Modularity, API

* API changes?
Minimal changes, mostly cleanup.
** Clean deprecated stuff like `searchShadowOwner`.
** If some queries are prominent (e.g. by name), better recognize the query inside the current
`searchObjects` method instead of introducing `searchByName`.
** Possibly add low-level query capability for management/monitoring reports/dashboards.
It would be described by input prism structure (parameters), output prism structure (projection)
and query directly in SQL.
Some (most used) reports would be predefined, the rest is up to the power user.
Upgrade problems possible, admin user must deal with those.

* Module design, currently audit is implemented in `repo-sql-impl`.
This is left for later, it's not such a problem to restructure Maven modules for new code.
Existing audit implementation, although separate, can still stay in `repo-sql-impl`.
Unused Hibernate entities for audit tables are still used for automatic DB creation, especially handy for H2/tests.
** Common SQL support (current "pure" package from the repo impl) should be extracted.
** What about `repo-cache`, do we need (or want) to change it?
*** Can be a performance problem on its own when there are too many queries.

== Testing and evaluation

* Testing considerations for automated TestNG tests:
** We want to develop tests that will be run on both 4.2 version (support branch) and in master.
** See xref:/midpoint/projects/midscale/design/testing-design/[Testing design] for more.

* How to get to minimum viable product (MVP) as soon as possible?
** In 4.3 we'd like to have rough implementation of `repo-api` (`RepositoryService`).
** In 1-2 months to have representative DB schema covering most issues mentioned above.
Testing on SQL level with many rows, etc.

== Schema to repository mapping

Table shows only descendands of `ObjectType`, not other containers, assignments, etc.

== Explored alternatives

=== No `m_object_oid` table, trigger for OID uniqueness

* OID must be unique across inherited tables, so `OID` on top-level table `m_object` was consulted.
* Parent tables cannot assure uniqueness, also can't have any index.
When select to OID was executed, UNION of all sub-tables was used internally.
This was reasonably fast, each table had its own OID index, but with more inherited tables
it was definitely slower than a single index check (see the table below).
* This solution did not allow for FK against OID on the parent tables.

Unique OID was assured by the following https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql-trigger.html[trigger]
based on http://blog.ioguix.net/postgresql/2015/02/05/Partitionning-and-constraints-part-1.html[this article]:

[source,sql]
----
-- This checks that provided OID is unique across all tables inherited from m_object.
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION object_oid_pk()
    RETURNS trigger
    LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $function$
BEGIN
    -- If update doesn't change OID, we don't want the expansive check.
    -- This can be also done with WHEN on CREATE TRIGGER, but only when INSERT and UPDATE
    -- triggers are set separately.
    IF NEW.oid = OLD.oid THEN
        -- returned VALUE ignored for AFTER trigger
        RETURN NULL;
    END IF;

    PERFORM pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(NEW.oid::text));

    IF count(1) > 1 FROM m_object WHERE oid = NEW.oid THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'duplicate m_object.OID value "%" while inserting into "%"',
        NEW.oid, TG_TABLE_NAME;
END IF;

    RETURN NULL;
END
$function$;

-- must be applied to all concrete (INSERT-able) tables like this:
CREATE CONSTRAINT TRIGGER m_resource_oid_check_tr AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON m_resource
    DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE object_oid_pk();
----

Following table show the effects of the count of inherited tables and volume of already inserted
rows on the time for adding 100k of new rows:

|===
| Inherited{nbsp}tables / Existing rows | 4 | 20 | 50 | 100

| 0 | 7s | 10s | 29/35/36s | 63s
| 500k | 6s | 10s | 21/32/23s | 63/34/65s
| 1M | 6s | 10s | 20/33/33s| 66/66/45s
| 5M | 16/10/21/7/7s | 11/13/13/12s | - | -
|===

Following loop was used, which is roughly 2x slower than `INSERT from SELECT` with `generate_series`
but I assume loop better represents many INSERTs from the application:

[source,sql]
----
DO
$$
    BEGIN
        FOR r IN 1000001..1100000
            LOOP
                INSERT INTO m_user (name_orig, version)
                VALUES ('user-' || LPAD(r::text, 10, '0'), 1);

                -- regular commit to avoid running out of memory with locks (NOT NECESSARY NOW)
                IF r % 1000 = 0 THEN
                    COMMIT;
                END IF;
            END LOOP;
    END;
$$;
----

Commit after each 1000 rows had little-to-no impact on the performance.

== Pagination

Various types of pagination are summed up in https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/03/30/five-ways-to-paginate/[this article].

For *pagination in the GUI* `OFFSET`/`LIMIT` seems to be the acceptable despite the performance
degradation with big values of `OFFSET`.
The reason is that GUI requires random access and first pages are accessed more than later/last pages.
Also, any inconsistency (suddenly added entry) is easy to explain and user probably knows what is happening.

For long term processes that need to process many items we use *keyset pagination*, e.g. using last
ID from current page to define the next page without any `OFFSET`, only using `LIMIT`.
This is very efficient *even when no additional index besides PK is used* - and it's natural, too.
It is called "top-N query" and typically the best thing is to order and filter it by the same index.
Even when ordered by ID with filters not using the index, it tends to be very fast unless
the required number of rows satisfying the condition is far from the beginning of the search.
While this may skip some items that are added after we processed the page (and at the same time
process other items added later that appear on later pages) it is more or less deterministic.
We can also avoid processing "future" items with `WHERE` clause using creation timestamp
(or current maximal ID, if sequential) at the processing start time.

Following techniques are generally not usable for us:

* *TID Scan* and *Keyset with Estimated Bookmarks* does not support `WHERE` clauses.
* *Cursor* pagination causes high client-server coupling and is state-full.
We don't want to hold the cursor for operations that can take longer and need transactions.
