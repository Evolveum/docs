<p>
    <a href="/midpoint/projects/midscale/">MidScale project</a> has an ambition to bring major changes to midPoint.
    We wanted to make sure that the changes are well aligned with the needs of midPoint community.
    Therefore we have conducted a survey about our plans in MidScale project.
    This was an opportunity for midPoint community to express the opinions and thoughts, and influence the future of midPoint.
</p>
<p>
    Although we received less responses that we have expected, the survey provided important insights.
    We have received 34 complete survey results.
    We greatly appreciate the effort of the people that took the time to fill out the survey.
    That time is well spent, as your opinions will influence the future of midPoint.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, the survey results seem to match with our existing plans.
    However, there are few surprises.
    Let's review the questions one by one.
</p>

<h2>Scalability, Performance and the Databases</h2>

<div class="survey-question">
    The goal of midScale project is to increase the total number of identities that midPoint instance can handle.
    We hope to be able to routinely support deployments with tens of millions of identities.
    How do you feel about this plan?

<p>
    Looks like midScale is addressing the needs of the community, even though these are future needs rather than current needs.
    Which is good, as it will take some time for us to finish midScale.
</p>

<div class="survey-question">
    Scalability and performance benefits of midScale will be available only for deployments that run on PostgreSQL database.
    The reason is that we need to use database-specific features and "tune" the implementation for a specific database engine.
    PostgreSQL will become primary midPoint database engine, strongly recommended for all midPoint deployments.
    How do you feel about this?

<p>
    We have expected that midPoint community is favorable towards PostgreSQL.
    However, 74% of answers indicating to be OK with PostgreSQL is even higher than we expected.
    This seem to validate our plan for PostgreSQL-based high-performance repository implementation.
</p>

<div class="survey-question">
    MidPoint has support for other databases (MS SQL, Oracle, ...) and some of these databases will be supported in the future.
    However, the code that supports these databases is database-agnostic, not optimized for any specific database engine.
    Therefore the scalability will be limited, and the performance is likely to be worse than the performance of PostgreSQL implementation.
    E.g. it is likely that such midPoint deployment may be able to handle maximum of 100,000 identities and peak loads will be limited to just a couple of requests/changes per second.
    Would you still use it?

    The purpose of this question was to determine, whether it is worth to maintain the traditional generic repository implementation.
    This is hard to call.
    There are 4 votes to keep the "old" repository against 19 votes that do not need it any longer.
    Yet, there are also 8 undecided votes.
    Which makes this indecisive.
    We do not want to abandon significant part of midPoint community, despite the majority of votes in favor of new repository.
    It is quite clear that we cannot drop the "old" repository immediately.
    And it was never the plan.
    We will maintain both implementations in parallel, at least for some time.
    This question cannot be clearly decided now, but we hope to get more insight in the future.

<p>
    PostgreSQL is a clear winner here.
    Again.
    Which is not really surprising, especially given the fact that is was a recommended database for midPoint deployment for a couple of years.
    The surprising fact is how dominant it is in midPoint community.
    It has more than twice the votes as its closes competitor.
    It it four times as popular as MySQL and MariaDB combined.

<div class="survey-question">
    MidPoint support for MySQL and MariaDB was deprecated in midPoint 4.1.
    MySQL/MariaDB are still supported, but the support will be removed eventually.

    We have deprecated MySQL and MariaDB support a couple of years ago.
    This question was supposed to give us some guideline regarding the timeline of removing the support.
    The answers could hardly by any clearer.
    Almost all of the answers indicated that removing MySQL/MariaDB is not going to be a big problem, nobody indicating it as an showstopper.
    The next logical step would be to drop MySQL/MariaDB support soon.
</p>

<div class="survey-question">
    We are contemplating our database support strategy for the future.
    We wonder whether there is significant mass to support Oracle/MSSQL or any other database.
    How would you feel if PostgreSQL becomes the only supported database in 5-8 year time frame?

    This is slightly less clear than the previous question.
    Majority of responses are OK with PostgreSQL-only midPoint.
    Yet, 10 people would like to stay with their current database, there are still 4 responses that are not in favor at all.
    Although nobody indicated this as a show-stopper, this is still something for us to consider.

    Designing auditing subsystem may seem like a simple job, but it is not.
    There are many choices to make, considering performance, storage capacity, maintainability, evolution of data formats and various other concerns.
    Yet, it looks like we have done quite a good job designing our auditing facility, as it looks just right for roughly half of the respondents.
    Significant part of the responses indicate a need for finer auditing, which is something we have to consider in the future.
    There were voices asking for more configurability in auditing, which we will definitely listen to.
    At least one thing is clear: nobody wants less data in their audit trails.

    When we originally designed the audit subsystem, we have expected that the data will not stay in midPoint database for long.
    We have expected that they will be pumped to other systems such as warehouses, SIEMs and so on.
    But it looked like this is not happening.
    We have seem people keeping the data in midPoint database, which was never designed to be keep long-term historical data.
</p>
<p>
    The answers to this question provides a very important insight for us.
    As we have suspected, most people would like to keep audit data in midPoint database.
    Which means that we will need to take long-term data storage into our considerations.
    However, the number of responses indicating integration with SIEM, data warehouses and even forensic tools is surprisingly high, considering relatively low interest about such topics in the past.
    This is certainly something we will need to consider in our plans.

    Answers to this question confirm our suspicion.
    You would like to store audit data in midPoint database for longer that we have originally expected.
    Most people want to to store the data for a year or just few years, however there was at least one answer indicating as long as 10 years of data retention.
    This is yet another indication that we need to improve mid-term to long-term storage of midPoint audit data.
    Luckily, nobody expects us to do any black magic here.
    We really appreciate that midPoint has such a pragmatic community.

    MidPoint has been supported on both UNIX/Linux and Windows platform.

    It does not look very favorable for Windows, does it?
    Only 3 votes for Windows, against 28 votes that do not mind dropping Windows support.
    This does not look well for the future of Windows platform support.
    Of course, midPoint will still be running on Windows.
    Even some of our own developers use Windows on their machines (although they are a minority).
    However, we will consider the future of production-level support for Windows.
</p>
<p>
    One of the respondents asked why we would even consider dropping Windows support.
    The answer is simple: to reduce support overhead.
    If we include Windows platform in our support, we also have to test midPoint on Windows platform, create and maintain start/stop scripts, consider Windows platform in midPoint documentation and so on.
    Most of these are small tasks that are done quickly.
    But there are many of them, we need to keep them in mind, they are a distraction.
    And then there are exotic issues, such as bugs related to filesystem paths (<code>/</code> versus <code>\</code> and <code>C:</code>), obscure platform-dependent Java virtual machine crashes, clustering-related issues and so on.
    Some of them may be tricky to resolve, it may need a lot of time.
    This is increasing cost of midPoint support for everybody.
    We are professionals, and we are more than willing to do all these things as long as there is sufficient demand to justify the costs.
    Yet, the answers from the survey seems to suggest that the demand for Windows platform support is very low.
    It looks we have to make decision here.
</p>

<div class="survey-question">
    MidPoint runs on Java platform.
    Java platform has changed its support model a couple of years ago.
    There is an long-term support (LTS) version of Java platform released every three years.
    Latest Java LTS release is Java 11, released in 2018. The next LTS release will be Java 17, planned for September 2021.
    We usually want to run midPoint on the latest Java LTS version.
    How do you feel about it?

    It looks like midPoint community is very progressive when it comes to new Java versions.
    Almost all of you can migrate to new Java version up to a year after it is released.
    This gives us hope for quick migration to Java 17.
    This is also an indication for us that we can move ahead to new Java versions quickly after their release.
    This is a very pleasant surprise, as Java platform upgrades used to be a problem in the past.
    Let us take these answer as an indication that this problem is gone now.

    Looks like Docker is really popular these days.
    We like Docker too, and we plan to move in that direction.
    The use of public/private cloud is really interesting.
    These are important data for our planning.

    The community seems to be divided to two almost equal groups here.
    We have 16 votes for cloud, 12 votes for more traditional approaches.
    It looks like we will need to support both.
    MidPoint has a good foundation in the traditional approach, and we plan to support these for any foreseeable future.
    However, it looks like we will have to invest more in the "cloudy" improvements in the future, to satisfy the desire for dynamic environments.
</p>

<div class="survey-question">
    We are thinking about new midPoint deployment model, packaging all the necessary components in one bundle.
    MidPoint, database, web server all bits and pieces neatly packaged together.
    We are thinking about using Docker compose or a similar technology.
    What do you think?

    Obviously, this question was about Docker, stand-alone Spring Boot application, and similar approaches.
    It looks like the community has a favorable opinion, as long as a reasonable amount of control over the environment is maintained.
    We understand, that the flexibility of midPoint is a very important aspect, and that reasonable amount of control over midPoint deployment will always be necessary.
    On the other hand, we also see value in simplification, and unification of the deployments.
    Only a small portion of community seems to keep <i>everything</i> under their control.
    This is a very important input for our decision making.

    It looks like majority will be fine somewhere around three nines (99.9%) availability, or slightly more than that.
    The opinion seems to be leaning towards fully-automatic recovery, which is perfectly understandable.

<div class="survey-question">
    Since midPoint 4.0, we have changed midPoint support lifetime policy.
    Now we have long-term support (LTS) releases with a three-year support lifetime and feature releases with one-year support lifetime.
    How do you like this approach?

<p>
    The LTS program seems to work fine overall.
    There seems to be some sentiment towards longer support.
    Which may be something to consider.
    However, longer support lifetime has its cost in money, time and developer capacity.
    These are very sensitive decisions to make.
    Fortunately, thank to you, now we have the data to base our decisions on.

<p>
    It looks like both LTS and feature releases are used in approximately equal proportions.
    We take it as a sign that the LTS/feature support model works well, both kinds of releases have their place and purpose.

    The results show half of you are active subscribers of our services and some are planning to acquire subscription soon or are in the process of evaluating midPoint.
    Thank you for participating this way on midPoint’s present state-of-the-art status.
    We would be happy for newcomers who would help us to enhance midPoint’s future.
    We really appreciate it.

<div class="survey-question">
    If you catch a golden fish that grants wishes, what would you wish us to do?
    You could have one wish, you could wish for improvement in midPoint, new feature, change in Evolveum services or policies, what would that wish be?
</div>

<p>
    Reviewing answers to this question was like walking a Garden of Eden.
    There were far-reaching wishes, such as AI.
    However, most wishes were very pragmatic and practical.
</p>
<p>
    System stability, especially in multi-threaded operations was mentioned several times.
    As was the DB schema and performance.
    Which is a good match, as that is in the scope of midScale project already.
</p>
<p>
    Improvement in documentation was mentioned many times.
    We are aware of this problem, and we are working on a solution.
    Your wishes are certainly helpful, they will give us data to correctly prioritize documentation work.
    However, midPoint is also quite big and comprehensive system.
    It is easy to document small and simple systems, but documentation of a comprehensive and very flexible system such as midPoint is quite a challenge.
</p>
<p>
    Wishes for simplifications and user experience improvements were also mentioned several times.
    We are certainly considering these, and we know that there are some important improvements that we have to make in this area.
    Unfortunately, there is only a finite amount of work that can fit into any particular release.
</p>
<p>
    There were also other wishes and suggestions.
    All the suggestions are important to us, and we will consider each one of them.
    This is important information that will help us decided on midPoint roadmap.

<p>
    We are happy that people from academia, higher education and research found time to participate in this survey.
    Based on this information we are able to make decisions how to be helpful for your vertical even more.
    We believe we have been improving midPoint in important way for organizations outside this vertical as well and we would get more feedback from them in the future survey.
    In addition, we see interest in midPoint by large organizations.
    Based on that, we find our decision to focus on midScale within 4.3 and 4.4 releases to be the right choice.
    Once midScale is finalised and the community including large organizations would see outcomes of our hard work, we believe there will be survey feedback from them as well to help us with making right decisions.
