This guide describes steps how to run midPoint, a comprehensive open source identity management and governance platform.

To have available full feature set there are requirements to utilized midpoint native repository.
To be able quickly and easily start the environment the containers are the preferred way.
There is docker-compose file available for quick start.
In case you have more complex environment there is available focused part of the docs with specific information for your use case.

== Quick start using Docker compose

[NOTE]
====
For the docker compose the docker environment is required.
The requirements for these environment is the availability od *docker engine*.

Docker documentation related to install based on OS:

* link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Linux - Docker engine] +
Directly docker engine can be installed.

* link:https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/[Windows - Docker Desktop] +
Fot the windows the docker engine is available only as part of Docker Desktop application.
Any install configuration of docker Desktop is suitable for our purpose.
Feel free to follow the default setting during the installation process..
====

To have working midPoint environment there is needed more thank just one application.
To be able to address this complexity we had prepare description file which can be easily processed - docker compose file.
This file contain the definition for all parts and also provide necessary settings.
The benefit for the user is that it can be "simply run" and the isolated working environment is available for you.
In case you are curious about the content see the documentation related to the installation using the xref:../install/containers[containers].

The following commands are the same for all Linux and Windows.

* Linux +
There can be directly run the terminal.

* Windows +
For the following command run the command line.

Download the docker compose file.
The directory name where the docker file will be located will be used by default by docker as prefix for the names of created objects.

To download you can use `curl` command or preferred browser using the link to github.

.Get available docker compose definition (@link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evolveum/midpoint-docker/master/docker-compose.yml[github])
[source,bash]
----
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evolveum/midpoint-docker/master/docker-compose.yml
----

Once the file is available we can start the environment (we are still in terminal / command line).

.start the environment in background
[source,bash]
----
docker compose up -d
----

It will take some time to start.
For a few seconds the web GUI will still not be available - it is expected.
There is initiation in progress - starting, loading init object to empty repository, etc.

In case you want to stop the container use the following command.
.stop the environment
[source,bash]
----
docker compose down
----

This command will stop the container but keep it defined - allocated the space.
The data stay available for next run.

To reset environment (clean up the data) you can use the following command:

.stop the midPoint environment and clean up the relevant data
[source,bash]
----
docker compose down -v
----

[WARNING]
====
Using *-v* parameter cause removing also the volumes.
Volumes are the space where the data is stored out of the container - persistent storage over the container remove / re-create.

In other words also user data related to the container will be removed - e.g. content of the DB (repository).
====

As a summary here is table with the most often used command.

.Summary available commands with docker compose.
[%autowidth]
|====
| Command | Result

| `docker compose up -d`
| Start the environment based on docker-compose file content

| `docker compose down`
| Stop the environment (the stored data is kept)

| `docker compose down -v`
| Stop the environment and clean up the relevant data

| `docker ps -a`
| List of currently used containers in the system.

|====

[NOTE]
====
In case you have installed Docker Desktop you have _additionally_ available also GUI to start and stop the environment.
There is no additional feature in comparison to command line usage.

The services from docker compose file are grouped.
The name of group is the name od directory where the docker compose file is located.

After first `docker compose up` command the environment is available in the list.
On the related row in the list there are button with allowed actions start/stop and remove.

== MidPoint User Interface

MidPoint has a web administration user interface.
This is a primary user interface to use and configure midPoint.
By default, the user interface is accessible at port `8080`:

`http://localhost:8080/midpoint/`

=== Logging In

Please log in to user interface as an `administrator` user.

[%autowidth, cols="h,1"]
|====
| Username | `administrator`
| Password | `Test5ecr3t`
|====

[WARNING]
====
For the security reason there is not default password.
With the first run there is initiated administrator user.
If the required password is not set there is generated one.

The password *Test5ecr3t* is set by the configuration in provided docker compose file.

For more information see xref:/midpoint/reference/security/authentication/administrator-initial-password/[Administrator Initial Password] doc page.

====

[NOTE]
====

In the releases before *4.8.1* (up to 4.8) there were default Password `5ecr3t`.
In case you are running one of these version there is following default credentials.

|====
| Username | `administrator`
| Password | `5ecr3t`

=== Have A Look Around

Administrator is an all-powerful user, therefore all the capabilities of midPoint are at your disposal.
Feel free to have a look around.
Some places of the user interface may be confusing, but you certainly find some fimiliar places:

* *Self service* part of the interface is used to manage the identity and privileges of a user that is currently logged in.

* *Administration* part of the user interface is used to manage user identities, roles, organizational structure and policies.
This part is used for routine administration of the system.
At this stage, this is perhaps the most interesting part of midPoint to explore.

* *Configuration* part of the user interface is used to customize midPoint behavior, going deep into midPoint internals.

=== Terminology

MidPoint is using terminology that is quite common in the identity management field, however it may be slightly confusing for people coming from other fields.
Following list explain basic midPoint terms:

* *User* means user record (profile) in midPoint database.
This data record usually contains unified data, synchronized from source systems.

* *Resource* is a remote system that is connected to midPoint.
It may a source system that feeds data to midPoint.
Or it may a target system, that is managed by midPoint.

* *Account* is a data structure (user profile) that resides on _resource_ (source or target system).
MidPoint reads data from accounts, or manages the accounts.

* *Role* gives privileges to users.
Role may also specify which _accounts_ on which _resources_ a _user_ should have.

== Next Steps

MidPoint will not do much on its own.
We need to connect midPoint to a source or target system (a _resource_) to see it shine.
However, midPoint is very powerful and comprehensive system, there are many things that can be set up, customized and adjusted when a new _resource_ is connected to midPoint.
The configuration may be somehow overwhelming for a new midPoint engineer.

It will take some time to get an understanding how midPoint works.
However, any time invested in learning midPoint will be paid back many times over.

There are three great ways how to start learning about midPoint:

There is a series of tutorials that is based on the book.
There are also other videos explaining various details of midPoint configuration and deployment.

* *xref:/book/[MidPoint Book]* provides a general introduction to identity management, it explains how midPoint works, it provides examples, ideas and tips for midPoint configuration, deployment and use.
This is _the_ book to learn about midPoint.
It is freely available for on-line reading and download.

* *https://evolveum.com/services/training-and-certification/[Trainings]* organized by Evolveum.
These are usually remote, instructor-lead trainings designed by midPoint authors.

There are also additional sources of information, that are usually suitable for engineers with some experience:

* *xref:/[docs.evolveum.com]*: This entire site is dedicated to documentation.
It is more than worth exploring the content.

* *xref:/community/mailing-lists/[MidPoint mailing lists]* are a great place to discuss midPoint.

* *xref:/talks/[Conference talks]* and workshop recordings are a good resource for people that like to sit back and listen.

== Frequently Asked Questions

=== MidPoint won't start

Q: MidPoint won't start, I cannot access the `8080` port.

A: MidPoint is a substantial software system.
It usually takes 1-2 minutes for midPoint to start up based on hardware.
You can monitor the progress of midPoint startup by looking at midPoint logs.

=== Something went wrong ...

Q: Something went wrong, I have no idea what is going on.

A: The best start to midPoint diagnostics is to have a look at midPoint logs.

The log is visible on the console or the standard docker logging mechanism is used: `docker logs midpoint_server`.

=== My first resource won't work

Q: My first resource won't work, there are connection errors, I can see no data, nothing works.

A: Have a look at the error message.
You can expand the error message to get more details about the problem.
However, please keep in mind that connecting new system to midPoint may be tricky.
There are nice systems that use standard protocols and provide good error messages.
However, many systems are not very nice.
They deviate from standards, require exotic configuration and return cryptic error messages.
It the resource does not work on the first try, it is usually helpful to <<resources,learn more>> about midPoint and its workings.
