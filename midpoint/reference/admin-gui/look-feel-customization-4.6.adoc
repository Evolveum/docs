== Stylesheets and javascripts without overlay

WARNING: Since midpoint 4.6 stylesheets can't be updated without modifying source code of midpoint or using overlay.

Starting with midPoint 4.6 whole css/js processing has changed.
NodeJS and Webpack 5 was incorporated into build.
Stylesheets, javascripts and other static resources are now processed using Webpack 5 and configuration defined in package.json.
