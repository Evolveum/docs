:page-visibility: draft

Following document describes different options and configuration possibilities for request access UI.

Configuration can be placed in admin gui configuration element - globally set is system configuration or in all roles.
See xref:../admin-gui-config/index.adoc#how-it-works[Admin GUI configuration] on how configuration is compiled when user logs in.

As for request access UI, configuration is merged on level of wizard steps, e.g.:

* Person of interest: `targetSelection`
* Relations: `relationSelection`
* Role catalog: `roleCatalog`
* Shopping cart: `checkout`
