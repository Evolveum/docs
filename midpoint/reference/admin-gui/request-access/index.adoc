Request access functionality is a complete rewrite and redesign of midPoint xref:../role-request/index.adoc[role requesting UI].

New UI takes form of proper wizard with up to four steps:

* Person of interest
* Relation
* Role catalog
* Shopping cart (checkout)

First two steps may be hidden, or skipped based on configuration or authorizations of user that is currently logged in.
