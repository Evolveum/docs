Role wizard is available from midPoint version 4.6.

Some wizard panels are configurable, for more information see xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/admin-gui-config/#wizard-panels[Wizard panels].

New UI takes form of some panels with choice for specific parts of resource configuration. Specific part of configuration is represented by a wizard with steps.

Midpoint support role wizard only for _Application role_ and _Business role_.

== Application role wizard
In the role wizard for the application role, we can select _Application_, set the new role's basic attributes, add users to the new role, and create a inducement for resource with associations and mappings.

We can skip the application selection and add a inducement in the step later.

The role is created after submitting the attributes. Next, we see titles with additional possibilities.
