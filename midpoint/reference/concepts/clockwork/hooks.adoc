Hooks are midPoint mechanism for injecting a code to or intercepting of normal midPoint flows.
E.g. a hook can be used to inset custom notification after an operation is complete, modify the operation request before it is even processed, redirect processing to a workflow or trouble-ticket system or do any other kind of advanced customization magic.
Hooks are invoked by wiki:Clockwork+and+Projector[Clockwork] component at appropriate stages of midPoint computation.

Hooks are typically pieces of Java code that has to be compiled and assembled into midPoint.
However there is also a lightweight way to wiki:Scripting+Hooks[create a hook using a scripting code].
