During midPoint operation, some data items gradually gather in the repository.
Typical examples are the following: tasks and audit records.

Therefore, midPoint provides a feature that automatically cleans-up the repository with respect to these items.
A system task named *Cleanup* runs (by default) every 24 hours and removes tasks and audit records older than predefined time value.
Its default configuration is the following:

[source,xml]
----
<c:cleanupPolicy xmlns:c="http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/common-2a">
	<c:auditRecords>
		<c:maxAge>P3M</c:maxAge>
	</c:auditRecords>
	<c:closedTasks>
		<c:maxAge>P1M</c:maxAge>
	</c:closedTasks>
</c:cleanupPolicy>
----

This configuration causes the cleanup task to remove all audit records older than three months (see link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[the ISO 8601 specification]) and all closed tasks that are more than one month after their completion.

Note: More precisely, when removing the tasks, only root tasks are considered.
When a root task is removed, all of its subtasks (that should be completed before the root) are removed as well.
