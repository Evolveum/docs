MidPoint logging is usually configured using the administration GUI.
But sometimes there is a need to log events that happen before logging can be configured.
Also the logging configuration is stored in midPoint repository (database).
Therefore it can only be applied if basic system infrastructure and wiki:Repository+Subsystem[repository subsystem] is initialized.
This page describes a method how to log events that happen before that.
E.g. how to diagnose issues with low-level system initialization, database initialization, etc.

The trick is to put `logback.xml` file in wiki:MidPoint+Home+Directory[MidPoint Home Directory]. This file will be applied during very early phases of system initialization.
The default initial logging configuration will be *replaced* with the content of this file.

.logback.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
    <logger name="PROFILING" level="TRACE"/>
    <logger name="com.evolveum.midpoint" level="TRACE" />
</configuration>
----

Alternatively a `logback-extra.xml` file can be used.
This file has the same format, but instead of replacing the default configuration it will be appended to it.
Any statements present in this file will be applied after the default (compiled-in) logging configuration is applied.

This should help to diagnose most of the problems.
But there are still some tricky problems that need one more trick.
The problem is that once the system goes to the point when the repository is initialized it will read the sytem configuration from the repository and apply it.
Logging configuration is part of the system config.
Therefore this logging configuration replaces the initial logging configuration from `logback.xml`. This may be a problem if you do not have access to the GUI and cannot change the logging configuration in the repository.
Therefore there is a config.xml setting that forces midPoint to skip the application of logging configuration from the repository:

.config.xml
[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
    ...
    <system>
        <skipRepositoryLoggingSettings>true</skipRepositoryLoggingSettings>
    </system>
</configuration>
----
