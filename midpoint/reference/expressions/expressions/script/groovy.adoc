== Examples

=== User name

Following code returns a `name` property of a user.
It is using groovy safe dereference operator (`?.`) to make sure this code works as expected even if user is `null`. User can be `null` is some situations, such as when evaluating outbound expression for a deleted user.
Therefore the use of safe dereference operator is advised in almost all situations.

[source,groovy]
----
user?.getName();
----

=== Create fullName

[source,groovy]
----
user.getGivenName() + " " + user.getFamilyName();
----
