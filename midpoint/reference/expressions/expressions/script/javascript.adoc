Its language URL is:

== Examples

=== User name

Following code returns a `name` property of a user.
It is using ternary operator (`?` and `:`) to make sure this code works as expected even if user is `null`. User can be `null` is some situations, such as when evaluating outbound expression for a deleted user.
Therefore the use of similar safe constructs is advised in almost all situations.

[source,javascript]
----
user == null ? null : user.getName();
----


=== Create fullName

[source,javascript]
----
user.getGivenName() + ' ' + user.getFamilyName();
----
