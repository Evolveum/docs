== Setup

Add to the end of `postgresql.conf`:

----
# this is necessary for pg_stat_statements extension
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'

# this is to log all the queries, just be aware of the free disk space
logging_collector = on
log_directory = 'pg_log'
log_filename = 'postgresql-%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S.log'
log_statement = 'all'
log_line_prefix = '%m [%p] %h %a: '
#log_connections = on
#log_disconnections = on
----

== Queries

// TODO this is various selects thrown here, need to sort it out and add some narrative

== Troubleshooting

When troubleshooting Postgres performance we need to check output of the following commands.
First in bash or other shell:

[source,bash]
----
df -h # disk sizes
free # memory statistics, often useless on containers
ps xau | grep -i postgres # what postgres process are running
----

In SQL:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE EXTENSION pg_buffercache; -- required before first use to enable pg_buffercache

-- What tables use memory buffers, pg_relation_size counts only table proper ("fork" they call it)
-- while pg_table_size would count TOAST and few more structures too, which we don't care so much.
-- Indexes are counted separately.
-- See the docs for more: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-DBSIZE
WITH settings (shared_buffers) AS (SELECT setting FROM pg_settings WHERE name='shared_buffers')
SELECT
    c.relname,
    pg_size_pretty(count(*) * 8192) as buffered,
    100, count(*), (SELECT shared_buffers FROM settings)::integer,
    round(100.0 * count(*) / (SELECT shared_buffers FROM settings)::integer, 2) AS buffers_percent,
    least(round(100.0 * count(*) * 8192 / pg_relation_size(c.oid),1), 100) AS percent_of_table
FROM pg_class c
INNER JOIN pg_buffercache b ON b.relfilenode = c.relfilenode
INNER JOIN pg_database d ON (b.reldatabase = d.oid AND d.datname = current_database())
GROUP BY c.oid,c.relname
ORDER BY count(*) DESC
LIMIT 10;
----

Then the use the SQL commands from section above to obtain settings and list of the largest objects.
After that any other relevant query depending on the situation - locks, vacuum info, etc.
