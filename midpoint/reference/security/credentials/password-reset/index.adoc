This configuration is valid in midPoint 4.6 and later. For configuration before 4.6 please see xref:./configuration-before-4-6/[Password Reset Configuration before 4.6].

[TIP]
.MidPoint 4.7 and later

New authentication modules were implemented to provide more flexible and convenient flow for password reset functionality.

Password reset feature provides a possibility to user to reset their password.
It is disabled by default.The following text describes how to enable and configure this feature.


== Enabling Password Reset

To enable password reset feature, it should be configured in the security policy referenced from system configuration.

`credentialsReset` element should be defined in security policy in order to specify the details of the password reset process. For example, the steps of the user authentication during password reset should be configured here.

`authenticationSequenceName` element points to the certain authentication sequence in which concrete steps/methods of the reset password process are defined.

[source,xml]
-----------------
<credentialsReset>
    <authenticationSequenceName>userPasswordResetAuth</authenticationSequenceName>
</credentialsReset>
-----------------

The following documentation describes the possible methods of the user authentication and its combination.

== Possible methods of the user authentication during password reset.

[%autowidth]
|===
|Module identifier | Description | Specific elements | Note

| attributeVerification
| The module can be used as an additional verification of the already authenticated user. Intended for interactive user verification by comparing the specified attribute with the value provided by the user.
| `path` element is a multivalue element which defines a list of the user attributes to be verified.
| Since 4.7

| focusIdentification
| The module can be used as the first step during password reset to find out the identity of the user.
| `path` element is a multivalue element, points to the user attribute(s)-identifier(s) which should be set to identify the user.
| Since 4.7

| hint
| Enables password hint step during password reset. If this module is configured, the user will be provided with an information about their password hint (if any present) as an attempt to remember the password.
|
| Since 4.7

| mailNonce
| Mail nonce authentication module. Module that sends randomly generated nonce in URL via mail.
|
| Nonce policy should be configured in the `credentials` element in security policy. For example:

<nonce>
<name>mailNonce</name>
<maxAge>PT10M</maxAge>
<valuePolicyRef oid="policy_oid" relation="org:default" type="c:ValuePolicyType"></valuePolicyRef>
</nonce>


| securityQuestionsForm
| The module is used for user authentication by answering a set of security questions.
|
| Security questions policy should be configured in the `credentials` element in security policy. For example:

<securityQuestions>
<name>securityQuestionsForm</name>
<questionNumber>2</questionNumber>
<question>
<identifier>http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/question-2#q001</identifier>
<enabled>true</enabled>
<questionText>How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if woodchuck could chuck wood?</questionText>
</question>
<question>
<identifier>http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/question-2#q002</identifier>
<enabled>true</enabled>
<questionText>What is your mother's best friend's uncle's granddaughter's dog's mother maiden name?</questionText>
</question>
</securityQuestions>

== Password Reset example with mail nonce module

From 4.1 midpoint support configuration for password reset via _xref:/midpoint/reference/security/authentication/flexible-authentication/configuration/[Flexible Authentication]_. We need configure authentication module for email nonce and authentication sequence for password reset. Finally, we set name of authentication sequence to _securityPolicy/credentialsReset/authenticationSequenceName_.

.Example of new configuration
[source,xml]
----
<securityPolicy>
...
   <authentication>
   ...
     <modules>
     ...
        <mailNonce>
            <name>MailNonce</name>
            <description> Authentication based on mail message with a nonce. Used for user registration.</description>
            <credentialName>mailNonce</credentialName>
        </mailNonce>
      </modules>
      ...
      <sequence>
        <name>userPasswordResetAuth</name>
        <description>Just a nonce mail to validate e-mail address.</description>
        <channel>
            <channelId>http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/channels-3#resetPassword</channelId>
            <urlSuffix>resetPassword</urlSuffix>
        </channel>
        <module>
            <name>MailNonce</name>
            <order>10</order>
            <necessity>sufficient</necessity>
        </module>
      </sequence>
   </authentication>
   <credentials>
      <nonce>
         <maxAge>PT2M</maxAge>
         <name>mailNonce</name>
         <valuePolicyRef oid="00000000-0000-1111-0000-000000000003" type="c:ValuePolicyType"><!-- Mail Nonce Policy --></valuePolicyRef>
      </nonce>
   </credentials>
   <credentialsReset>
      <authenticationSequenceName>userPasswordResetAuth</authenticationSequenceName>
   </credentialsReset>
</securityPolicy>
----
When we use _nonceModule_ authentication module means that the confirmation link is sent to the user's email.
After clicking on the confirmation link, user is prompted for new password.

The confirmation link is generated and validated using value policy referenced from the attribute _xref:/midpoint/reference/security/credentials/password-policy/[valuePolicyRef]_. The correlation between password reset and nonce generation settings is done through attribute _additionalAuthenticationName. mailReset_ configuration has reference to the authentication method (attribute _additionalAuthenticationName_) used to confirm the password reset process.
Concrete authentication method (_mailAuthentication_ in this case) contains setting for generating and validating nonce_. _

After nonce is successfully generated it is sent in the validation link to the user's mail.
To be able to send this confirmation link to the user, it is needed to configure notifications (in the system configuration).
Example for such configuration is shown in the following sample:

.Example for notification configuration
[source,xml]
----
<passwordResetNotifier>
    <recipientExpression>
    	<script>
			<code>return requestee.getEmailAddress()</code>
        </script>
    </recipientExpression>
    <bodyExpression>
        <script>
            <code>

            	import com.evolveum.midpoint.notifications.api.events.ModelEvent
                modelEvent = (ModelEvent) event
                newUser = modelEvent.getFocusContext().getObjectNew();
                userType = newUser.asObjectable();

	            link = midpoint.createPasswordResetLink(userType)
		        bodyMessage = "Did you request password reset? If yes, click on the link below \n" + link

		        return bodyMessage;
            </code>
        </script>
	</bodyExpression>
    <transport>mail</transport>
</passwordResetNotifier>
----

While using custom body expression don't forget to generate the link.
There is a method in midPoint function library which will generate the link - midpoint.createPasswordResetLink(userType).

== Password Reset example with multiple authentication modules

Starting from version 4.7 a possibility to extend security policies is implemented. This means that different groups of user can have different policies for password reset (and for authentication in general). The security policy which should be applied to the user (or to the group of the users) can be defined in several places in midPoint: in global security policy (assigned in system configuration), in the organization to which the user belongs, in the structural archetype (or its super-structural-archetypes) which is assigned to the user. All security policies which are defined in the specified objects are merged into one with next order: "closer" to user security policies have higher priority. This means the security policy from the user's archetype can extend/override a security policy from super archetype, super archetype security policy can extend/override a security policy from organization, a security policy from the organization can extend/override a global security policy.

Let's have a look at the use case when the user gets security policies from different places. In this example reset password sequence has several authentication modules defined:

* first of all the user has to enter their identifier (name attribute in this case);
* after the user is identified, they are redirected to the hint module. In case the user doesn't have a defined password hint value, the module should be skipped;
* if the hint information doesn't help the user to remember the password, the user should continue password reset procedure. The next module is security questions form;
* after security questions are answered successfully, the user is redirected to the attributes verification module where additionally user's nickName attribute will be verified;
* after all previous modules were processed successfully, the user gets to the password reset panel where they can set new password and hint values.

== Password reset and custom form

It isn't probably difficult to imagine that current password reset form doesn't satisfy everyone's needs.
Using just email address (which in addition references to the concrete field and cannot be changed without changing the source code) to find an user which is requesting the password reset might not satisfy requirements.
With introducing xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/custom-forms/[custom forms] they can be used to specify custom form for user identification.
All what is needed to be done is to add the reference to form in the password reset cofiguration as below:

Password reset and custom form

 <credentialsReset>
    ...

    <formRef oid="bb42fa87-b066-48a0-a960-c77fc8b53737" type="c:FormType"><!-- Password reset form --></formRef>
</credentialsReset>
