#TODO check if GUI supports this#

// [NOTE]
// ====
// Currently, we do not provide any analytic capabilities regarding the classification of shadows.
// This is unlike higher-level processing, where any changes are stored into "simulation results" and can be analyzed after the simulation.
// The classification of shadows is always updated right in the repository, and has to be analyzed there.
//
// (This is not considered to be a persistent, externally visible effect, as these shadows should not be linked to any focal objects.
// So their classification and re-classification is viewed as internal midPoint data manipulation.)
//
// We may consider adding analytical capabilities here later.
