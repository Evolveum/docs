= Resource Object Correlation Fine-Tuning
:page-since: "4.7"
:page-upkeep-status: green

#TODO#

// Typical questions to be asked during tuning the correlation configuration:
//
// * What will be the correlation/synchronization situation (no owner, existing owner, disputed owner, or already linked owner) for all or selected shadows?
// And who are the candidate owners?
// * How many shadows would have changed their correlation/synchronization situation after a particular change is done in the classification configuration?
// (Or simply after an updated correlation configuration is applied.)
// Which ones will that be?
// How many and which ones of them are already in the "production" state?
// How many and which ones of them are already linked to a user?
//
// The fine-tuning of the correlation process ends by marking this part of resource configuration as "in production"footnote:[Again, the terminology is unclear yet.].
// After the next run of an appropriate synchronization task, the correlation is executed in production mode, and shadow's synchronization situation is determined for good.footnote:[Other effects are to be decided: The shadow can be linked to its owner. It can be also turned to the "production" mode.]
