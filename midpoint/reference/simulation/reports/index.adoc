Simulation results can be displayed interactively via midPoint GUI, or their content can be exported using the
xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/reports/configuration/[reporting] functionality.

There are the following built-in simulation reports.

== Results

This is the most high-level report on simulation results.
It shows individual results, along with #TODO#

Individual columns:

[%autowidth]
[%header]
|===
| Column | Description
| OID
| OID of the simulation result object.
| Name
| Name of the simulation result object.
Usually contains information about the task that produced the report (if any), identifier of the simulation result configuration used (if any), and the timestamp of the simulation report creation.
| Definition identifier
| Identifier of the simulation result definition used (if any).
| Start timestamp
| When this simulation started.
| End timestamp
| When this simulation ended.
| Task
| Task under which this simulation executes or executed.
(Empty for foreground simulations.)
| Production configuration
| #TODO# this will be changed (either true/false or set name)
2+| The following part of the report is instantiated once per each simulation xref:../results/metrics.adoc[metric] (event mark-based or custom one).
| Event mark
| Event mark corresponding to the metric row. (If applicable.)
| Custom metric
| Custom metric identifier corresponding to the metric row. (If applicable.)
| Aggregation function
| Aggregation function used for given metric.
See xref:../results/aggregation-functions.adoc[].
2+| The following part of the report is instantiated once per each xref:../results/partitions.adoc[metric partition].
| Scope: type
| Type of objects (user, role, org, shadow, ...).
| Scope: archetype
| Structural archetype of the objects. Applicable only to focal objects.
| Scope: resource
| Resource on which the projection (shadow) resides. Applicable only to projections.
| Scope: kind
| Kind of the projection (shadow). Applicable only to projections.
| Scope: intent
| Intent of the projection (shadow). Applicable only to projections.
| Value
| Aggregated value of the metric for given partition.
| Selection size
| Number of objects selected by given metric.
(The meaning of this field is metric-dependent.
The default meaning is "all objects that have metric value greater than zero".)
| Selection total value
| Sum of metric values for all objects selected by the metric.
| Domain size
| Number of objects on which given metric was evaluated.
| Domain total value
| Sum of metric values for all objects.
