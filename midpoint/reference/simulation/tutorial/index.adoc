= Simple Simulation Tutorial
:page-toc: top
:page-since: "4.7"
:page-upkeep-status: green

This is a simple tutorial describing the new xref:/midpoint/reference/simulation/[simulations] feature.

NOTE: The reader is expected to have reasonable knowledge of midPoint; we don't describe individual steps in much detail here.

NOTE: The simulations feature requires midPoint 4.7 or later, and the native (PostgreSQL-based) repository.

The overall scenario is that we connect HR system - represented by a CSV file - to midPoint.
Then, we will connect the target system, represented again by a CSV file.

Source files for this tutorial are in link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/tree/master/samples/simulation/tutorial[midPoint samples] repository.

== Step 1: Viewing the Raw HR Data

. Create a directory for CSV files (like `~/sim-tutorial`) and copy the link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/simulation/tutorial/hr.csv[HR CSV file] there.
. Check that the `filePath` in link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/tree/master/samples/simulation/tutorial/resource-hr-1.xml[HR definition #1] that it matches the location of the copied CSV file.
. Import the HR definition #1 into midPoint.
Note that the lifecycle state of the resource is `proposed`, so it is in the development mode.
+
.Listing 1: The resource definition #1
[source,xml]
----
<resource oid="236dd5ca-47df-403c-82e1-9ce2f36be000">
    <name>hr</name>
    <lifecycleState>proposed</lifecycleState>
    <connectorRef type="ConnectorType"> ... </connectorRef>
	<connectorConfiguration> ... </connectorConfiguration>
</resource>
----

. List the accounts on the resource.
You should see something like this:
+
.Content of HR resource
image::unclassified-accounts.png[Content of HR resource]

Note that the accounts are not classified: their intent is `unknown`.

== Step 2: Definition of an Object Type

The initial definition contains no object types.
So, let us define one.
Please import link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/tree/master/samples/simulation/tutorial/resource-hr-2.xml[HR definition #2].
(Do not forget to check the CSV file location before, as usual).

.Listing 2: The resource definition #2
[source,xml]
----
<resource oid="236dd5ca-47df-403c-82e1-9ce2f36be000">
    <name>hr</name>
    <lifecycleState>proposed</lifecycleState>
    <connectorRef type="ConnectorType"> ... </connectorRef>
	<connectorConfiguration> ... </connectorConfiguration>
    <schemaHandling>
        <objectType>
            <kind>account</kind>
            <intent>default</intent>
            <default>true</default>
            <delineation>
                <objectClass>ri:AccountObjectClass</objectClass>
            </delineation>
        </objectType>
    </schemaHandling>
</resource>
----

Now, list the accounts on the resource again.
You should see something like this:

.Content of HR resource with preliminary classification
image::accounts-intent-default.png[Content of HR resource with preliminary classification]

The intents were immediately set to `default`, because the accounts were not classified before.

== Step 3: Change the Definition of the Object Type

Imagine we want to change the definition of the object type so that employees will have the intent of `person`.
Let us do that in link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/tree/master/samples/simulation/tutorial/resource-hr-3.xml[HR definition #3].

.Listing 3: The resource definition #3
[source,xml]
----
<resource oid="236dd5ca-47df-403c-82e1-9ce2f36be000">
    <name>hr</name>
    <lifecycleState>proposed</lifecycleState>
    <connectorRef type="ConnectorType"> ... </connectorRef>
	<connectorConfiguration> ... </connectorConfiguration>
    <schemaHandling>
        <objectType>
            <kind>account</kind>
            <intent>person</intent>
            <default>true</default>
            <delineation>
                <objectClass>ri:AccountObjectClass</objectClass>
            </delineation>
        </objectType>
    </schemaHandling>
</resource>
----

Now, let us import the definition and check the accounts.
Their intents have not changed. #TODO check after GUI is updated#
Why?
Because - by default - the GUI does not engage the development mode when listing the content of a resource.

To re-classify the accounts from `default` to `person` we have two options:

. Delete the shadows and let midPoint re-create them.
(This was the only option before version 4.7.)
. Read the content of the resource in simulation mode with development configuration enabled.
This is currently doable using synchronization (e.g. import) tasks. Here are two alternatives:
a. Execute the re-classification directly.
b. Simulate the re-classification.
Unlike the standard simulation, this is a special low-level simulation that captures assumed changes on shadow objects.
In 4.7, it is an xref:/midpoint/versioning/experimental/[experimental functionality].

Let us go through options 2b and 2a now.

=== Simulation of Re-classification Process (experimental functionality)

==== Running the Simulation

Import the following link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/tree/master/samples/simulation/tutorial/task-hr-import-shadow-management-simulation.xml[task]:

.Listing 4: A task that simulates the accounts re-classification

                    <objectclass>ri:AccountObjectClass</objectclass>
                </resourceObjects>

            <configurationToUse>
                <productionConfiguration>false</productionConfiguration> <!--2-->
            </configurationToUse>
            <createSimulationResult>true</createSimulationResult> <!--3-->
        </execution>
    </activity>
</task>
----
<1> Selects the (experimental) low-level simulation that captures changes to the shadows during classification and correlation.
<2> Instructs midPoint to use development configuration, not the production one.
<3> Enables the creation of the simulation result object.
Without this option, the simulation would run, but its results would not be captured.

==== Viewing the Results

After running it, the classification of the shadows will _not_ change, but a new simulation result is created.
It looks like this:

.Simulation result capturing the shadows reclassification
image::result-after-reclassification.png[Simulation result capturing the shadows reclassification]

We see that the classification of both shadows would be changed.
We can look at the details by clicking on "Shadow classification changed" mark, and then on a shadow:

.Reclassified objects
image::result-after-reclassification-details.png[Reclassified objects]

.Reclassified object details
image::result-after-reclassification-details-2.png[Reclassified object details]

==== Creating a Report

The results can be also exported into CSV, by running a report named _Simulation report: Items changed_, with the following parameters:

. `simulationResultRef` pointing to the simulation result created;
. `pathsIncluded` set to `intent` to avoid showing changes in synchronization timestamps;
. `showIfNoDetails` set to `false`.

#TODO fix the report to provide reasonable labels for parameters#

(The preview in GUI does not work with these kinds of reports. Execute the report to create the CSV file.)

After opening the CSV in the spreadsheet and hiding unimportant columns it will look like this:

.Reclassified objects report
image::result-after-reclassification-report.png[Reclassified objects report]

=== Running the Re-classification

After we are satisfied with the expected re-classification results, we can run the re-classification in real.

Import the following link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/tree/master/samples/simulation/tutorial/task-hr-import-full-simulation.xml[task]:

        </execution>
    </activity>
</task>
----
<1> This is the "main" (full) simulation.
The low-level operations on shadows (classification, correlation state determination) are carried out.
Changes to focus objects and resource objects are not executed.

After running the task and listing the accounts, we see their intent was changed to `person`.

.Content of HR resource after re-classification
image::accounts-intent-person.png[Content of HR resource after re-classification]

As an exercise, you can try running the simulated reclassification task again and check there are no simulated re-classification now.

== Step 4: Simulation of Inbound Mappings

So we can assume the resource object classification is OK now.
Let us prepare some inbound mappings and synchronization reactions.
Please import link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/tree/master/samples/simulation/tutorial/resource-hr-4.xml[HR definition #4].

</resource>
----

Traditional import from GUI does nothing, because it simply does not "see" the resource configuration:
just as if there were no mappings nor synchronization reactions defined.

There is a possibility to preview (simulate) the import.
But be sure to check the preview that uses the development configuration, otherwise there will be no effects at all.

#TODO implement preview with development configuration in GUI and describe it here#

To simulate the execution of mappings in background task, let us import the link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/tree/master/samples/simulation/tutorial/task-hr-import-full-simulation.xml[full simulation task].

After looking at the simulation result, we should see "2 focus activations" and after clicking on that mark, we will see users that are going to be added.
After displaying the details of the first of them, we see the following:

.Preview of the first user added
image::user-after-first-import.png[Preview of the first user added]

We see that our mappings work correctly.

== Step 5: Switching the Resource into Production

Now we can change the lifecycle state of the resource to `active`, making it part of the production configuration.
After that, we can run the link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/tree/master/samples/simulation/tutorial/task-hr-import.xml[regular HR import task].

We observe that two users were added.

We may now run the simulated import and check that there are no computed changes.

.Four unmodified objects
image::four-unmodified-objects.png[Four unmodified objects]

== Step 6: Extending the Resource

Len us imagine that we want to add a mapping for `telephoneNumber`.
We cannot put the whole resource back into development mode, but we can do that for the particular mapping.

Please import link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/tree/master/samples/simulation/tutorial/resource-hr-5.xml[HR definition #5].

            <delineation>
                <objectClass>ri:AccountObjectClass</objectClass>
            </delineation>
            <attribute>
                <ref>ri:phone</ref>
                <inbound>
                    <lifecycleState>proposed</lifecycleState>
                    <strength>strong</strength>
                    <target>

            <synchronization> ... </synchronization>
        </objectType>
    </schemaHandling>
</resource>
----

After running the (full) simulation of import from HR, the result contains two deltas like this:

.Telephone number change
image::telephone-number-delta.png[Telephone number change]

After we are satisfied with the mapping, we can put it into production mode (`lifecycleState` = `active`) and run the import task in "persistent-effects" mode.
