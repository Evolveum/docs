= Control Flow

Here we describe the definition of control flow for link:index.adoc[activities].

Note that not all of these options are supported for all activities.
Usually, activities marked as non-multi-threading capable (like cleanup) also do not support
these options.

[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Item | Meaning | Default

| `processingOption`
| Controls whether the specified activity is executed: if set to `skip`, the activity is skipped.
| For simple activities, it is `process`. But for sub-activities in predefined composite activities,
it may be different: e.g. the preview-related sub-activities in recomputation are skipped by default.

| `bucketProcessingCondition`
| Condition for processing or analysing specific buckets. (If present and if returns false, the
bucket is marked as complete without any processing, and the next bucket is fetched.)
| Processing all buckets.

| `itemProcessingCondition`
| Condition for processing specific items. (If present and if returns false,
the item processing is skipped, and the next item is fetched.)
| Processing all items.

| `errorHandling`
| Error handling strategy for this activity. (A preliminary description is link:https://docs.evolveum.com/midpoint/reference/tasks/task-error-handling/[here]. To be updated!)
| Depends on specific activity.

| `parallelExecution`
| Whether the child activities should be executed in parallel.
(This is applicable only to composite activities.)
| `false`

Items planned but *not implemented yet*:

|===
| Item | Meaning | Default
| `activityPrecondition`
| An expression that governs whether the current activity should be executed or skipped,
or whether the task should stop altogether. Should return a single value
of `ActivityPreconditionOutputType`.
| Pass.

| `prerequisite`
| Set of prerequisites i.e. activities that must be complete before this one can start.
| The activity just before this one (the sequential processing).

| `repeatedExecution`
| Should be the activity re-executed when the task is restarted (e.g. resumed)?
