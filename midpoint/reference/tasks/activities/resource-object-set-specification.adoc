= Resource Object Set Specification

Here we describe how sets of resource objects are specified in link:index.adoc[activities].
(Represented by `ResourceObjectSetType` type.)

[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Item | Meaning | Default
| `resourceRef` | Resource against which we want to execute the activity. | No default (value must be specified).
| `kind` | Kind of objects to be processed. | TODO
| `intent` | Intent of objects of given kind to be processed. | TODO
| `objectclass` | Class of objects to be processed. | TODO
| `query` | Object query used to refine/replace the default query stemming from the above parameters. | None.
| `queryApplication` | How should be resource object set query applied to the basic query stemming from
`resourceRef` / `objectclass` / `kind` / `intent` specification. | Depends on activity. E.g. `replace` for import from resource.
| `searchOptions` | Search options to use. | No options.
| `failedObjectsSelector` | Used for activities intended to re-process objects that failed to be processed by a "regular" activity
that was run before. See link:../object-set-specification/#_failed_objects_selector[here]. | No failed objects selection. (Processing all objects.)
|===

TODO describe the effect of various combinations, e.g.

* no kind, intent, objectclass specified
* only kind present
* kind+intent present
* only OC present
* kind+intent+OC present

| Value | Meaning
| `append` | Specified query is "appended" to the default query that results from
the resourceRef/kind/intent/objectclass tuple.
| `replace` | Specified query replaces the default query that results from
the resourceRef/kind/intent/objectclass tuple.
