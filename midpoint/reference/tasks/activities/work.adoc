= Work Definition

This section defines _what_ the activity should do (i.e. the action) and on what _items_ (the item set).
As of midPoint 4.4, the following items are supported:

[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Item | Meaning | Parameter | Meaning | Default

.2+| `recomputation`
.2+| Recomputes specified objects.
| `objects`
| What link:../object-set-specification/[objects] to recompute.
| All of `AssignmentHolderType`.

| `executionOptions`
| What options to use.
| `reconcile`

| `import`
| Imports specified resource objects.
| `resourceObjects`
| What link:../resource-object-set-specification/[resource objects] to import.
| This is obligatory parameter.

| `reconciliation`
| Reconciles specified resource objects.
| `resourceObjects`
| What link:../resource-object-set-specification/[resource objects] to reconcile.
| This is obligatory parameter.

| `asynchronousUpdate`
| Processes asynchronous updates for given resource objects (EXPERIMENTAL)
| `updatedResourceObjects`
| What link:../resource-object-set-specification/[resource objects] to receive updates for. (Not all configuration items are supported - TODO.)
| This is obligatory parameter.

.3+| `liveSynchronization`
.3+| Processes live synchronization events for give resource objects
| `resourceObjects`
| What link:../resource-object-set-specification/[resource objects] to synchronize.
| This is obligatory parameter.
| `batchSize`
| If a positive value of `N` is specified here, live synchronization fetches
at most `N` records during each `provisioning.synchronize()` method execution - i.e. during
any live sync task run. (Currently, it leaves unprocessed changes for the next live sync
task run. This may change in the future.)

*USE WITH CARE.* This feature assumes that the connector provides LiveSync capability
with `preciseTokenValue` = `true`, i.e. that it assigns sync tokens to individual changes
"incrementally", so it can resume live sync operation on each individual change. This
can be the case of SQL connectors, but e.g. not for CSV or LDAP ones.
| 0
| `updateLiveSyncTokenInDryRun`
| Indicates if the LiveSync token should be updated when running in dry run mode.
If `false` (the default) then LiveSync will not update token to a new value, so it
will process objects fetched on the next run (either dry or normal). If `true`, it
will update the token, and therefore marks objects as processed.
| `false`
