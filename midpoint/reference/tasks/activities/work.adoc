= Work Definition (Types of Activities)

This section defines _what_ the activity should do (i.e. the action) and on what _items_ (the item set).
As of midPoint 4.4, the following items are supported (MT means "Supports multi-threading", MN means "Support multi-node operation"):

[%header]

|===
| Item | Meaning | Activity type | MT | MN | Parameter | Meaning | Default

.2+| `recomputation`
.2+| Recomputes specified objects.
.2+| Simple
.2+| Y
.2+| Y
| `objects`
| What xref:../object-set-specification/[objects] to recompute.
| All of `AssignmentHolderType`.
| `executionOptions`
| What options to use.
| `reconcile`

| `import`
| Imports specified resource objects.
| Simple
| Y
| Y
| `resourceObjects`
| What xref:../resource-object-set-specification/[resource objects] to import.
| This is obligatory parameter.

| `reconciliation`
| Reconciles specified resource objects.
| Predefined composite
| Y
| Y
| `resourceObjects`
| What xref:../resource-object-set-specification/[resource objects] to reconcile.
| This is obligatory parameter.

| `asynchronousUpdate`
| Processes asynchronous updates for given resource objects (EXPERIMENTAL).
| Simple
| Y
| N
| `updatedResourceObjects`
| What xref:../resource-object-set-specification/[resource objects] to receive updates for. (Not all configuration items are supported - TODO.)
| This is obligatory parameter.

.3+| `liveSynchronization`
.3+| Processes live synchronization events for give resource objects.
.3+| Simple
.3+| Y
.3+| N
| `resourceObjects`
| What xref:../resource-object-set-specification/[resource objects] to synchronize.
| This is obligatory parameter.
| `batchSize`
| If a positive value of `N` is specified here, live synchronization fetches
at most `N` records during each `provisioning.synchronize()` method execution - i.e. during
any live sync task run. (Currently, it leaves unprocessed changes for the next live sync
task run. This may change in the future.)

*USE WITH CARE.* This feature assumes that the connector provides LiveSync capability
with `preciseTokenValue` = `true`, i.e. that it assigns sync tokens to individual changes
"incrementally", so it can resume live sync operation on each individual change. This
can be the case of SQL connectors, but e.g. not for CSV or LDAP ones.
| 0
| `updateLiveSyncTokenInDryRun`
| Indicates if the LiveSync token should be updated when running in dry run mode.
If `false` (the default) then LiveSync will not update token to a new value, so it
will process objects fetched on the next run (either dry or normal). If `true`, it
will update the token, and therefore marks objects as processed.
| `false`

| `cleanup`
| Cleans up obsolete objects: audit records, closed tasks, closed cases, closed certification
campaigns, output reports, and dead nodes.
| Predefined composite
| N
| N
| `policies`
| Cleanup policies to be used. (Specifying typically max. age and/or max. number of records to keep.)
| Global cleanup policies defined in the system configuration.

.2+| `reportExport`
.2+| Exports any report in a "classical" way. (Does not support bucketing.)
.2+| Simple
.2+| Y
.2+| N
| `reportRef`
| Definition of the report.
| Obligatory.
| `reportParam`
| Definition of the report parameters.
| No parameters.

.2+| `distributedReportExport`
.2+| Exports a report on repository objects or audit records.
.2+| Predefined composite
.2+| Y
.2+| Y
| `reportRef`
| Definition of the report.
| Obligatory.
| `reportParam`
| Definition of the report parameters.
| No parameters.

.3+| `reportImport`
.3+| Imports a report.
.3+| Simple
.3+| Y
.3+| N
| `reportRef`
| Definition of the report.
| Obligatory.
| `reportParam`
| Definition of the report parameters.
| No parameters.
| `reportDataRef`
| Report data to be imported.
| Obligatory.

.2+| `iterativeScripting`
.2+| Executes a script (a.k.a. bulk action) over a set of objects.
.2+| Simple
.2+| Y
.2+| Y
| `objects`
| What xref:../object-set-specification/[objects] to process.
| All objects in repo.
| `scriptExecutionRequest`
| Script to execute (`ExecuteScriptType`). Contains scripting expression, `options`, and `variables`. Note: `input` can be set,
but it is ignored.
| Obligatory.

| `nonIterativeScripting`
| Executes a script (a.k.a. bulk action) on an empty or explicitly specified input. NOTE: not implemented yet, but hopefully will be in 4.4.
| Simple
| N
| N
| `scriptExecutionRequest`
| Script to execute (`ExecuteScriptType`). Contains scripting expression, `input`, options`, and `variables`.
| Obligatory.

.3+| `focusValidityScan`
.3+| Executes validity scan on focal objects. Works in one of two modes:

In _standard mode_ it recomputes all objects that have at least one validity interval
(`validFrom`/`validTo` for object or any of its assignments) falling into an interval of (`lastScanTimestamp`, `currentTime`],
where `lastScanTimestamp` is the timestamp of last executed scan.

In _custom validity constraint mode_, it looks for objects that have specified `property` fall between (`lastScanTimestamp`-`offset`, `currentTime`-`offset`]
where `offset` is a value given in the explicit validity constraint (the `activateOn` value). It recomputes these objects, with the
explicitly added triggered validity policy rule. Note that this is an *experimental* functionality.

.3+| Predefined composite
.3+| Y
.3+| Y
| `objects`
| What xref:../object-set-specification/[objects] to scan. If a query is present, the filter computed
by the activity is added to it (as a conjunction).
| All of `FocusType`.
| `queryStyle`
| How to find the objects: `singleQuery` - issues a single (combined) query, looking for objects and their assignments,
or `separateObjectAndAssignmentQueries` - issues two queries: one for objects, another for assignments. The latter runs
in two separate sub-activities.
| `singleQuery`
| `validityConstraint`
| Custom validity constraint. See above.
| None.

| `triggerScan`
| Executes trigger scan on repository objects. Invokes trigger handlers for any triggers that have fire time less than or equal `currentTime`.
(Unlike validity scanner, this one intentionally ignores `lastScanTimestamp`.)
| Simple
| Y
| Y
| `objects`
| What xref:../object-set-specification/[objects] to scan. If a query is present, the filter computed
by the activity is added to it (as a conjunction).
| All of `ObjectType`.

| link:https://docs.evolveum.com/midpoint/reference/tasks/shadow-refresh-task/[`shadowRefresh`]
| Looks for pending operations in shadows and updates their status.
| Simple
| Y
| Y
| `shadows`
| What xref:../object-set-specification/[shadows] to process. If a query with filter is present, it _replaces_ the default query.
If a query without filter is present, the default filter is "implanted" into it (reusing e.g. the ordering).
| All shadows with pending operations.

.3+| `changeExecution`
.3+| Executes specified changes on specified objects.
.3+| Simple
.3+| Y
.3+| Y
| `objects`
| What xref:../object-set-specification/[objects] to process.
| All of `ObjectType` (can be dangerous!)
| `delta`
| What delta to apply.
| Obligatory.
| `executionOptions`
| What execution options to use.
| Default execution options.

| `reindexing`
| Re-indexes specified repository objects.
| Simple
| Y
| Y
| `objects`
| What xref:../object-set-specification/[objects] to reindex.
| All of `ObjectType`.

.2+| `shadowCleanup`
.2+| Deletes all shadows that have not been updated for given time. (I.e. their `fullSynchronizationTimestamp` is either null or less or equal "current time - specified interval".)
.2+| Simple
.2+| Y
.2+| Y
| `shadows`
| What xref:../resource-object-set-specification/[shadows] to check. The task works only if given resource is not in maintenance mode. If a query is specified, it is always
appended to the default time-scanning query.
| Obligatory.
| `interval`
| How "stale" must be a shadow to be deleted.
| Obligatory.
