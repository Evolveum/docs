Synchronization tasks are midPoint xref:/midpoint/architecture/concepts/task/[server tasks] that handle bulk xref:/midpoint/reference/synchronization/introduction/[synchronization] of midpoint objects.
Synchronization tasks typically take care of scheduled user reconciliation or continuous live synchronization.
But the tasks can be used in an ad-hoc manner to handle migration tasks such as initial user import or cleanup and administration tasks such as ad-hoc user recompute.

[TIP]
====
All the synchronization tasks are using the same xref:/midpoint/reference/synchronization/introduction/[synchronization mechanism]. See the xref:/midpoint/reference/synchronization/introduction/[Synchronization] page for an introduction.

For all the synchronization tasks to work correctly the xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/synchronization/[synchronization section] of xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/[resource configuration] must be set up properly.
See xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/synchronization/[Synchronization Configuration] page for more details.
====


== Target Specification

The synchronization task needs to know what it has to synchronize.
The task needs to know:

* What *resource* to synchronize.
This is specified by using the `objectRef` property of the task.

* What *objects* on the resource to synchronize.
It has to know which xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/shadow/kind-intent-objectclass/[object classes, kinds or intents] to synchronize.
This is specified using the properties `objectclass`, `kind` and `intent` of the task extension.

[NOTE]
====
MidPoint 3.2 has a capability to synchronize all objects (all object classes) of a particular resource that supports it.
This feature introduced a change in the meaning of object specification:

In midPoint 3.2 and later, if there is no object specification (objectclass, kind or intent) then the task will try to synchronize all object classes.
This may fail if the resource or the synchronization mechanism does not support synchronization of all object classes.

In midPoint versions prior to 3.2, if there was no object specification then the task located a default account object type and used that for synchronization.

== Live Synchronization

== Reconciliation

The following task will run reconciliation on resource `ef2bc95b-76e0-48e2-86d6-3d4f02d3e1a2`. It will reconcile objects of `inetOrgPerson` object class.
The reconciliation will be running every hour (3600 seconds).

== Import

[TIP]
====
Import of default accounts can be initiated from the midPoint GUI by clicking the "Import Accounts" button on resource details page.
====

The following task will import all objects of `inetOrgPerson` object class from resource `ef2bc95b-76e0-48e2-86d6-3d4f02d3e1a2`. The task will run only once.
