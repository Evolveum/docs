== Quality

Release 2.2.1 (_Crius_ Update 1) is intended for full production use in enterprise environments.
All features are stable and well tested.

The following list is list of *tested* platforms, i.e. platforms on which midPoint team or reliable partners personally tested this release.
The version numbers in parentheses are the actual version numbers used for the tests.
However it is very likely that midPoint will also work in similar environments.
Also note that this list is not closed.
MidPoint can be supported on almost any reasonably recent platform (please contact Evolveum for more details).


=== Java

* Sun/Oracle Java SE Runtime Environment 7 (1.7.0_25)

Please note that Java 6 environment is no longer supported (although it might work in some situations).

== Background and History

midPoint is roughly based on OpenIDM version 1. When compared to OpenIDM v1, midPoint code was made significantly "lighter" and provides much more sophisticated features.
Although the architectural outline of OpenIDM v1 is still guiding the development of midPoint almost all the OpenIDM v1 code was rewritten.
MidPoint is now based on relative changes and contains advanced identity management mechanisms such as advanced RBAC, provisioning consistency and other advanced IDM features.
MidPoint development is independent for more than two years.
The development pace is very rapid.
Development team is small, flexible and very efficient.
Contributions are welcome.

For the full project background see the xref:/midpoint/history/[midPoint History] page.

== Known Issues

. Extra values in tolerant multi-value attributes with high-order dependencies bug:MID-1561[]. Workaround: set the attribute to non-tolerant.

. AD connector does not distinguish error types (bug:MID-1562[]) therefore the applicability of consistency mechanism on AD is limited (bug:MID-1556[]). Workaround: use liveSync or frequent reconciliation.

. Search filters are not resolved when using Roles->Edit role as well as in debug pages (bug:MID-1571[]). Workaround: Maintain roles configurations in XML files outside midPoint.
When you need to upload updated version of a role to midPoint, use "import from file" function.

. When importing large number of accounts from LDAP server (import from resource), be sure to suspend LDAP live sync task as it may cause severe performance problems (bug:MID-1549[]) - this is basically caused by live sync task trying to process LDAP changelogs, which have already been processed by import itself.
If you forgot to suspend live sync task during initial LDAP import, there is another workaround.
Simply suspend LDAP live sync task, then edit this task on debug pages and delete <token> element in <extension> element.
Then resume LDAP live sync task and issue is fixed.

. Linux/Solaris connector can't fetch users - account attributes invalid names (bug:MID-1547[]).

. Midpoint incorrectly detects Script capability for resources (bug:MID-1511[]).
