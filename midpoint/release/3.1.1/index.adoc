<p>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimar_Sinan">Mimar Sinan</a> (1489-1588) was the chief Ottoman architect and civil engineer.
    He was responsible for the construction of more than 300 structures ranging from simple roads to magnificent marvels of architecture.
    The list of his works is very long and it includes surprisingly high number of civic structures that provided benefit to the society: colleges, bath-houses, inns, public kitchens, bridges, store houses, granaries, schools, aqueducts and hospitals.
    Sinan remained in the post of chief architect for almost fifty years which made him one of the most productive and versatile architect in history.
</p>
<p>
    Much alike many of Sinan's structures MidPoint version 3.1 brings stability, usability and other benefits to midPoint users.
    User interface improvements makes midPoint accessible to a broad user community.
    Diagnostics and stability improvements contribute to easy operation and maintenance of midPoint deployments.
    Similarly to Sinan himself MidPoint 3.1 is meant to be very productive and versatile.
    It can be deployed surprisingly quickly and supports wide variety of deployment types.
    MidPoint 3.1 is suitable for management of enterprise employee identities, customer identities, Internet identities or any kind of identities in almost any kind of environment.

Majority of the work on the _Sinan_ release was done by the link:http://www.evolveum.com/[Evolveum] team.
However, this release would not be possible without the help of our partners, customers, contributors, friends and families.
We would like to express a great gratitude to all the people that contributed to the midPoint project.

== Quality

Release 3.1.1 (_Sinan_ Update 1) is intended for full production use in enterprise environments.
All features are stable and well tested.

MidPoint is known to work well in the following deployment environment.
The following list is list of *tested* platforms, i.e. platforms that midPoint team or reliable partners personally tested this release.
The version numbers in parentheses are the actual version numbers used for the tests.
However it is very likely that midPoint will also work in similar environments.
Also note that this list is not closed.
MidPoint can be supported in almost any reasonably recent platform (please contact Evolveum for more details).

== Upgrade


=== Upgrade from midPoint 2.x

Upgrade from version 2.x is possible but it is not publicly supported.
It requires several manual steps.
Evolveum provides this upgrade as part of the subscription or professional services.


=== Upgrade from midPoint 3.0

Upgrade path from MidPoint 3.0 goes through midPoint 3.1. Upgrade to midPoint 3.1 first (refer to the wiki:Release+3.1[midPoint 3.1 release notes]). Then upgrade from midPoint 3.1 to 3.1.1.


=== Upgrade from midPoint 3.1

MidPoint 3.1.1 data model is backwards compatible with midPoint 3.1. However as the data model was extended in 3.1.1 the database schema needs to be upgraded using the wiki:Database+Schema+Upgrade[usual mechanism].


=== Changes in initial objects since 3.1

MidPoint has a built-in set of "initial objects" that it will automatically create in the database if they are not present.
This includes vital objects for the system to be configured (e.g. role `superuser` and user `administrator`). These objects may change in some midPoint releases.
But to be conservative and to avoid configuration overwrite midPoint does not overwrite existing objects when they are already in the database.
This may result in upgrade problems if the existing object contains configuration that is no longer supported in a new version.
Therefore the following list contains a summary of changes to the initial objects in this midPoint release.
The complete new set of initial objects is in the `config/initial-objects` directory in both the source and binary distributions.
Although any problems caused by the change in initial objects is unlikely to occur, the implementors are advised to review the following list and assess the impact on case-by-case basis:

* 010-value-policy: Allow no password

* 020-system-configuration: explicitly disabled auditing

* 030-role-superuser, 040-role-enduser.xml: roleType set to "system"

* 090-report-audit, 100-report-reconciliation, 110-report-user-list, 111-report-reconciliation-shadow-owner: completely new report setting

* 107-report-user-accounts, 108-report-user-orgs, 109-report-user-roles: deleted


== Background and History

midPoint is roughly based on OpenIDM version 1. When compared to OpenIDM v1, midPoint code was made significantly "lighter" and provides much more sophisticated features.
Although the architectural outline of OpenIDM v1 is still guiding the development of midPoint almost all the OpenIDM v1 code was rewritten.
MidPoint is now based on relative changes and contains advanced identity management mechanisms such as advanced RBAC, provisioning consistency and other advanced IDM features.
MidPoint development is independent for more than two years.
The development pace is very rapid.
Development team is small, flexible and very efficient.
Contributions are welcome.

For the full project background see the wiki:midPoint+History[midPoint History] page.
