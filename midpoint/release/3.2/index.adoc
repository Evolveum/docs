<p>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a> (1546-1601) was a Danish astronomer.
    He was known for his exact astronomical observations that refuted the belief in an unchanging celestial realm.
    Tycho's observations were an essential contribution to the scientific revolution and influenced many scientists that came after Tycho's time.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly to Tycho's empirical data midPoint version 3.2 brings features that make it more anchored into reality.
    Governance features bring the ability to feed back reality into the policies and continually sustain IDM deployment.
    And very like Tycho's observations the midPoint 3.2 user experience exposes aspects of reality that might otherwise be missed.

== Platforms

MidPoint is known to work well in the following deployment environment.
The following list is list of *tested* platforms, i.e. platforms that midPoint team or reliable partners personally tested this release.
The version numbers in parentheses are the actual version numbers used for the tests.
However it is very likely that midPoint will also work in similar environments.
Also note that this list is not closed.
MidPoint can be supported in almost any reasonably recent platform (please contact Evolveum for more details).

* OpenJDK 7 (1.7.0_65, 1.7.0_79)

* Sun/Oracle Java SE Runtime Environment 7 (1.7.0_45, 1.7.0_40, 1.7.0_67, 1.7.0_72)

Please note that Java 6 environment is no longer supported (although it might work in some situations).

Java 7 is supported for development, build and runtime.
Java 8 is only supported for runtime.


=== Web Containers

== Upgrade


=== Upgrade from midPoint 2.x

Upgrade from version 2.x is possible but it is not publicly supported.
It requires several manual steps.
Evolveum provides this upgrade as part of the subscription or professional services.


=== Upgrade from midPoint 3.0 and 3.1

Upgrade path from MidPoint 3.0 goes through midPoint 3.1 and 3.1.1. Upgrade to midPoint 3.1 first (refer to the xref:/midpoint/release/3.1/[midPoint 3.1 release notes]). Then upgrade from midPoint 3.1 to 3.1.1 and then to 3.2.


=== Upgrade from midPoint 3.1.1

MidPoint 3.2 data model is essentially backwards compatible with midPoint 3.1.1. However as the data model was extended in 3.2 the database schema needs to be upgraded using the xref:/midpoint/reference/upgrade/database-schema-upgrade/[usual mechanism].

MidPoint 3.2 is a major release that fixes some issues of previous versions.
Therefore there are some changes that are not strictly backward compatible.
There are two important upgrade tasks and a few additional concerns:

* MidPoint 3.2 switched to a completely new xref:/connectors/connectors/com.evolveum.polygon.connector.ldap.LdapConnector/[LDAP Connector]. This connector is expected to resolve many xref:/connectors/connid/1.x/icf-issues/[issues] of the original Sun ICF framework that are still felt today.
However this is a completely new connector and it is not backward compatible with the old connector.
There is a separate page describing the migration: xref:/midpoint/reference/upgrade/connectors/ldap-connector-migration/[LDAP Connector Migration]

* New ConnId framework brings support for synchronization of all object classes.
This lead to a change of default behavior of synchronization processes.
If no objectclass, kind or intent were specified in the synchronization process old midPoint versions used default account definition.
The new midPoint versions will try to synchronize all object classes in this case.
However, this will fail for resources that do not support the option to synchronize all object classes (which is currently the majority of all resources).
Therefore it is strongly recommended to explicitly configure objectclass or kind/intent in existing synchronization tasks.

* User interface (UI) authorization URLs were using wrong URI prefixes in previous midPoint versions (link:https://jira.evolveum.com/browse/MID-1965[MID-1965]). MidPoint 3.2 fixed that issue.
However, this means that UI authorizations configured for previous midPoint versions needs to be updated.
UI authorization URI prefix changed from `http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-3` to `http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-ui-3`.


=== Changes in initial objects since 3.1.1

MidPoint has a built-in set of "initial objects" that it will automatically create in the database if they are not present.
This includes vital objects for the system to be configured (e.g. role `superuser` and user `administrator`). These objects may change in some midPoint releases.
But to be conservative and to avoid configuration overwrite midPoint does not overwrite existing objects when they are already in the database.
This may result in upgrade problems if the existing object contains configuration that is no longer supported in a new version.
Therefore the following list contains a summary of changes to the initial objects in this midPoint release.
The complete new set of initial objects is in the `config/initial-objects` directory in both the source and binary distributions.
Although any problems caused by the change in initial objects is unlikely to occur, the implementors are advised to review the following list and assess the impact on case-by-case basis:

* 040-role-enduser: corrected UI authorization URIs (link:https://jira.evolveum.com/browse/MID-1965[MID-1965])

* 090-report-audit: significantly improved audit log report


== Background and History

MidPoint is roughly based on OpenIDM version 1. Although the architectural outline of OpenIDM v1 is still guiding the development of midPoint almost all the OpenIDM v1 code was rewritten.
MidPoint has evolved dramatically from these early times.
It is now based on relative changes and contains advanced identity management mechanisms such as advanced RBAC, provisioning consistency and other advanced IDM features.
Governance features are currently being developed and are already available in a form of technology preview.
MidPoint development is independent for more than four years.
MidPoint is currently several times bigger than other competing systems.
The development pace is rapid but stable.
Development team is small, flexible and very efficient.
Contributions are welcome.

For the full project background see the xref:/midpoint/history/[midPoint History] page.
