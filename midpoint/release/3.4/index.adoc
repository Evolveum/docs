<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a>  (1901-1976) was German theoretical physicist and one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics.
    He is best known for the formulation of the uncertainty principle. He also made important contributions to hydrodynamics, nuclear physics, ferromagnetism and several other fields of physics.
    In 1932 Werner Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.
</p>
<p>
    Heisenberg's uncertainty principle asserts that there is an inherent limit to the precision with which certain physical properties of a particle can be known.
    Similarly to Heisenberg's principle midPoint 3.4 accepts that there is some degree of uncertainty when it comes to processing of the identity data.
    It may not be practically possible to always base the decisions on authoritative data.
    Practical identity management system needs to accept that the identity data are always in a state of flux.
    New mechanisms are needed to efficiently handle and process such ever changing data and midPoint 3.4 brings such mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
    MidPoint 3.4 introduces the first in the series of governance and compliance mechanisms: access certification.
    This makes midPoint the first open source IDM system that entered the field of identity governance.
    Access certification campaigns can now be defined, executed and automatically remediated.
    MidPoint 3.4 also brings significantly improved and streamlined user interface.
    Similarly to the work of Werner Heisenberg that advanced the field of quantum mechanics, midPoint 3.4 has a good chance to cause a "quantum leap" in the field of identity management.

== Quality

Release 3.4 (_Heisenberg_) is intended for full production use in enterprise environments.
All features are stable and well tested.

=== Limitations

* MidPoint 3.4 comes with a bundled LDAP-based eDirectory connector.
This connector is stable, however it is not included in the normal midPoint support.
Support for this connector has to be purchased separately.

== Platforms

MidPoint is known to work well in the following deployment environment.
The following list is list of *tested* platforms, i.e. platforms that midPoint team or reliable partners personally tested this release.
The version numbers in parentheses are the actual version numbers used for the tests.
However it is very likely that midPoint will also work in similar environments.
Also note that this list is not closed.
MidPoint can be supported in almost any reasonably recent platform (please contact Evolveum for more details).

== Upgrade


=== Upgrade from midPoint 2.x

Upgrade from version 2.x is possible but it is not publicly supported.
It requires several manual steps.
Evolveum provides this upgrade as part of the subscription or professional services.


=== Upgrade from midPoint 3.0, 3.1, 3.1.1 and 3.2

Upgrade path from MidPoint 3.0 goes through midPoint 3.1, 3.1.1 and 3.2. Upgrade to midPoint 3.1 first (refer to the xref:/midpoint/release/3.1/[midPoint 3.1 release notes]). Then upgrade from midPoint 3.1 to 3.1.1, from 3.1.1 to 3.2 then to 3.3 and finally to 3.4.


=== Upgrade from midPoint 3.3 and 3.3.1

MidPoint 3.4 data model is essentially backwards compatible with both midPoint 3.3 and midPoint 3.3.1. However as the data model was extended in 3.4 the database schema needs to be upgraded using the xref:/midpoint/reference/upgrade/database-schema-upgrade/[usual mechanism].

MidPoint 3.4 is a release that fixes some issues of previous versions.
Therefore there are some changes that are not strictly backward compatible.

* Version numbers of the bundled connectors have changed (LDAP, CSVfile and DatabaseTable connectors).
Therefore connector references from the resource definitions that are using the bundled connectors need to be updated.

* The namespace of live sync tokes was changed from `http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/provisioning/liveSync-1.xsd` to `http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/provisioning/liveSync-3`. This change should be harmless in most cases. However, during the upgrade some synchronization changes may go missing. This should be easy to fix by synchronizing the changes manually or by executing a reconciliation process. A completely safe migration procedure is to stop the live sync processes before upgrade, change the live synchronization token namespace in process extension (XML), upgrade midPoint and then re-start the processes again.

* Workflow configuration variables processCheckInterval and allowApproveOtherItems were moved from config.xml to system configuration object.

* A reminder: XPath2 scripting was deprecated in midPoint 3.3 and it is not supported in Java8 environment.
XPath2 support will be removed soon.
Please migrate your XPath2 scripts to Groovy, Python or JavaScript.

MidPoint configuration of approvers and approval schemas is fully backward compatible and does not need any upgrade.
However the structure of Activity workflows was changed in midPoint 3.4. There is no universal migration path for running pre-3.4 workflows to 3.4 workflows.
For deployments that are actively using workflows we recommend letting all running workflow processes finish before upgrading to midPoint 3.4. After finishing, manual deletion of those workflow processes is strongly recommended.
For deployments that require migration of running workflow processes we recommend using midPoint subscription and ask for a migration path for that specific deployment.

The midPoint database schema was changed in midPoint 3.4 release.
The migration SQL scripts are provided at the usual place.
These scripts will update the database schema and they will also migrate existing data if that is possible to do on the SQL level.
However there are some properties where the SQL-based migration is not possible.
The migration/reindex task to handle complete data migration was not included in the midPoint 3.4 release by mistake.
However, the midPoint 3.4 is robust enough to still work with data that are not fully migrated.
Therefore for many deployments the data migration is usually not an immediate concern and it can be postponed to the planned 3.4.1 release which will include convenient migration/reindex task.
If the data are not fully migrated the only known limitation is the search by `displayName`, `identifier`, `ownerRef` and `riskLevel` properties of roles, orgs and services.
This search will not work properly (this affects only searches of `identifier` and `displayName` in org objects, other properties were not searchable in midPoint 3.3.1 and earlier, therefore that should no impact existing deployments upgrading to 3.4).
In case that full data migration is required even in midPoint 3.4 there is a work round to force data migration by exporting and re-importing all roles, orgs and services.


=== Changes in initial objects since 3.3 and 3.3.1

MidPoint has a built-in set of initial objects that it will automatically create in the database if they are not present.
This includes vital objects for the system to be configured (e.g. role `superuser` and user `administrator`). These objects may change in some midPoint releases.
But to be conservative and to avoid configuration overwrite midPoint does not overwrite existing objects when they are already in the database.
This may result in upgrade problems if the existing object contains configuration that is no longer supported in a new version.
Therefore the following list contains a summary of changes to the initial objects in this midPoint release.
The complete new set of initial objects is in the `config/initial-objects` directory in both the source and binary distributions.
Although any problems caused by the change in initial objects is unlikely to occur, the implementors are advised to review the following list and assess the impact on case-by-case basis:

* 020-system-configuration.xml: changed userDashboardLinks colors

* 040-role-enduser.xml: updated authorizations

* 041-role-approver.xml: new file

* 042-role-reviewer.xml: new file

* 090-report-audit.xml: minor fixes

* 110-report-user-list.xml: minor fixes

* 120-security-policy.xml: new file

* 130-report-certification-definitions.xml: new file

* 140-report-certification-campaigns.xml: new file

* 150-report-certification-cases.xml: new file

* 160-report-certification-decisions.xml: new file

* 200-lookup-languages.xml: new file

* 210-lookup-locales.xml: new file


=== Behavior changes since 3.3 and 3.3.1

* *Object template and assignment focus mappings with normal strength* were fixed.
Due to a bug in the code in previous midPoint versions these mappings behaved in a way which was very similar to strong mappings.
In midPoint 3.4 these mappings behave as they should.
However, this may break previous configurations that relied on the wrong behavior, especially when it comes to multi-value items such as assignments.
The solution would be to change strength of these mappings to _strong_.

* There were several changes to the behavior of *inbound mappings*, mostly focused on unifying the behavior and making inbound mappings more predictable.
Firstly, inbound mappings now can target also containers and references.
Secondly, inbound mappings are now made to behave in non-tolerant manner.
I.e. the inbound mapping will remove any values that are not explicitly given by the mapping.
This behavior can be changed by setting the tolerant flag of the *mapping* (not the attribute) to true.
This is currently an experimental feature.
Enable it if you have mappings that behave in relativistic way (i.e. correctly react to changes), and you wish that they do not remove values given by other means (e.g. by direct GUI edit).
However, currently it is strongly advised to avoid that situation - i.e. it is not advised to have properties that have inbound mappings and which can also be modified by other means.
In such cases it is better to create a new property that will be set exclusively by the means of inbound mapping and then use object template to derive the final target value.


=== Public interface changes since 3.3 and 3.3.1

* MidPoint authentication process was re-implemented and the underlying libraries (Spring Security) were upgraded.
This may bring slight changes in result and error codes for authentication and authorization failures.
This may affect all remote interfaces.


=== Important internal changes since 3.3 and 3.3.1

These changes should not influence anyone using the midPoint.
These changes should also not influence the XML-based customizations or scripting expressions that rely just on the provided library classes.
These changes will influence midPoint forks and deployments that are heavily customized using the Java components.

* The audit Java API was changed to allow passing `target` values for which we do not have full object (just OID).

* Numerous change in GUI classes and package names.
See xref:/midpoint/devel/gui/gui-development-guide/[GUI Development Guide]


== Known Issues

* When account references resource which references connector that has been upgraded, linkref is removed from user bug:MID-3251[]

* Error when object has extra extension attributes in repo bug:MID-3249[]
