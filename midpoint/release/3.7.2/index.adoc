<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Charles_Darwin</a> (1809 - 1882) was English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for the theory of evolution.
    Darwin's famous book On the Origin of Species described theory of evolution, mechanism of natural selection that explains the diversity of life.
    His voyage on HMS Beagle established him as an eminent geologist and made him famous as a popular author.
    Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history.
</p>
<p>
    Darwin's theory of evolution is the unifying theory of the life sciences.
    The theory describes the process how species evolve and adapt over successive generations.
    MidPoint 3.7 is such an evolutionary step in midPoint development.
    This midPoint release brings gradual improvements in many diverse areas.
    Identity governance features are improved, both in capabilities of the engine and the user interface.
    MidPoint expressions have gained more power and ease of use. There are notable improvements in user interface, security, task management and many smaller improvements in various areas.
    The scope of almost the entire release was guided by midPoint subscribers and sponsors - which provided the perfect environment for this step in midPoint evolution.

=== Limitations

* MidPoint {release-version} comes with a bundled LDAP-based eDirectory connector.
This connector is stable, however it is not included in the normal midPoint support.
Support for this connector has to be purchased separately.

== Platforms

MidPoint is known to work well in the following deployment environment.
The following list is list of *tested* platforms, i.e. platforms that midPoint team or reliable partners personally tested with this release.
The version numbers in parentheses are the actual version numbers used for the tests.
However it is very likely that midPoint will also work in similar environments.
Also note that this list is not closed.
MidPoint can be supported in almost any reasonably recent platform (please contact Evolveum for more details).


=== Java

* OpenJDK 8 (1.8.0_91, 1.8.0_111, 1.8.0_151)

* Sun/Oracle Java SE Runtime Environment 8 (1.8.0_45, 1.8.0_65, 1.8.0_74, 1.8.0_131)

=== Web Containers

* Apache Tomcat 8 (8.0.14, 8.0.20, 8.0.28, 8.0.30, 8.0.33, 8.5.4)

* BEA/Oracle WebLogic (12c) -  special subscription required

[NOTE]
.Web container (application server) support
====
MidPoint 3.7 introduced xrefv:/midpoint/reference/before-4.8/deployment/stand-alone-deployment/[Stand-alone deployment] form that does not need an application server.
This is the primary deployment model for midPoint.
The deployment to web container is still supported.
However the only supported web container is Apache Tomcat.
Other web containers (application servers) may be supported if the support is explicitly negotiated in midPoint subscription.
Except for those cases midPoint development team will not provide any support for other web containers.

Currently there are no plans to remove support for deployed midPoint installation using a WAR file.
However, it is possible that this deployment form will get phased out eventually unless there are active subscribers preferring this deployment method.
MidPoint subscription is strongly recommended if you plan to use this method in the future.
====

=== Databases

* H2 (embedded, only recommended for demo deployments)

* PostgreSQL (8.4.14, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.4.5, 9.5, 9.5.1) +
Support for PostgreSQL 8.4 is deprecated.
The support will be dropped in the future.

* MariaDB (10.0.28)

* MySQL (5.6.26, 5.7) +
Supported MySQL version is 5.6.10 and above (with MySQL JDBC ConnectorJ 5.1.23 and above). +
MySQL in previous versions didn't support dates/timestamps with more accurate than second fraction precision.

* Oracle 11g (11.2.0.2.0) +
Oracle 11g support is deprecated in midPoint 3.7. This will be replaced for Oracle 12c support in midPoint 3.8.

* Microsoft SQL Server (2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2014) +
Support for Microsoft SQL Server 2008 and 2008 R2 is deprecated.
The support will be dropped in the future.

=== Supported Browsers

* Firefox (any recent version)

* Safari (any recent version)

* Chrome (any recent version)

* Opera (any recent version)

* Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 9 or later)

Recent version of browser as mentioned above means any stable stock version of the browser released in the last two years.
We formally support only stock, non-customized versions of the browsers without any extensions or other add-ons.
According to the experience most extensions should work fine with midPoint.
However, it is not possible to test midPoint with all of them and support all of them.
Therefore, if you chose to use extensions or customize the browser in any non-standard way you are doing that on your own risk.
We reserve the right not to support customized web browsers.

Microsoft Internet Explorer compatibility mode is *not* supported.

[NOTE]
.Stand-alone deployment model
====
MidPoint 3.7 deployment method has changed.
xrefv:/midpoint/reference/before-4.8/deployment/stand-alone-deployment/[Stand-alone deployment] is now the default deployment method.
MidPoint default configuration, scripts and almost everything else was adapted for this method.

* *New midPoint users* and *new deployments* should simply follow the xref:install.adoc[installation manual].

* *Existing deployments* may keep using exactly the same configuration as before.
xref:/midpoint/install/bare-installation/webapp-deployment/[Deployment of midPoint as Web Application] is still supported as an alternative.
However, xrefv:/midpoint/reference/before-4.8/deployment/stand-alone-deployment/[stand-alone deployment] is now the primary option.
It is recommended to migrate the deployment based on application server to a stand-alone deployment in the future.
See our xrefv:/midpoint/reference/before-4.8/upgrade/tomcat-to-standalone/[brief migration guide].
====

== Upgrade

MidPoint is software that is designed for easy upgradeability.
We do our best to maintain strong backward compatibility of midPoint data model, configuration and system behavior.
However, midPoint is also very flexible and comprehensive software system with a very rich data model.
It is not humanly possible to test all the potential upgrade paths and scenarios.
Also some changes in midPoint behavior are inevitable to maintain midPoint development pace.
Therefore we can assure reliable midPoint upgrades only for https://evolveum.com/services/[midPoint subscribers].
This section provides overall overview of the changes and upgrade procedures.
Although we try to our best it is not possible to foresee all possible uses of midPoint.
Therefore the information provided in this section are for information purposes only without any guarantees of completeness.
In case of any doubts about upgrade or behavior changes please use services associated with https://evolveum.com/services/[midPoint subscription] or purchase https://evolveum.com/services/professional-services/[professional services].


=== Upgrade from midPoint 3.0, 3.1, 3.1.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.3.1, 3.4, 3.4.1, 3.5, 3.5.1, 3.6, 3.6.1 and 3.7

Upgrade path from MidPoint 3.0 goes through midPoint 3.1, 3.1.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4.1, 3.5.1 and 3.6.1. Upgrade to midPoint 3.1 first (refer to the xref:/midpoint/release/3.1/[midPoint 3.1 release notes]). Then upgrade from midPoint 3.1 to 3.1.1, from 3.1.1 to 3.2 then to 3.3, then to 3.4.1, 3.5.1, 3.6.1 and finally to 3.7.2.

=== Upgrade from midPoint 3.7 and 3.7.1

MidPoint 3.7.2 data model have not changed since midPoint 3.7. Therefore there is no need to update the database.

=== Changes in initial objects since 3.7 and 3.7.1

There were no changes to initial object since midPoint 3.7.

=== Bundled connector changes since 3.7 and 3.7.1.

LDAP and AD connectors were upgraded to latest versions.

=== Behavior changes since 3.7

* URLs used by xrefv:/midpoint/reference/before-4.8/deployment/stand-alone-deployment/[Stand-Alone Deployment] were changed to match the URLs used by Tomcat-based deployments of midPoint 3.6 and earlier.
This means that all deployment forms now use `/midpoint/` context root path in the URL by default (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/midpoint/`). This choice was made based on user feedback to keep the compatibility with previous midPoint versions and to keep the two deployment models as closely aligned as possible.
For the stand-alone deployment there is an automatic HTTP redirect from the root URL (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/`) to midPoint context root (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/midpoint/`). Therefore in midPoint 3.7.2 both deployment method should behave in a natural, expected and compatible way.

* Processing of authorizations for proxy authentication in the REST interface was corrected.
The processing of proxy authorizations now behave as documented.

* Processing of object authorizations was corrected.
Authorizations now take into consideration also the properties of existing removed containers even in _replace_ and _id-only delete_ cases.
Therefore, appropriate property authorization is needed even when deleting a value that contains those properties.

* Password reset schema was deprecated.
Existing password reset configuration still works, but it will be replace by xrefv:/midpoint/reference/before-4.8/security/credentials/password-reset/new-configuration/[new password reset configuration] in the future.

=== Public interface changes since 3.7

* REST interface was extended with experimental password reset method.

=== Important internal changes since 3.7

There were not critical internal changes since midPoint 3.7.


++++
{% include release-issues.html %}

There is a support to set up storage of credentials in either encrypted or hashed form.
There is also unsupported and undocumented option to turn off credential storage.
This option partially works, but there may be side effects and interactions.
This option is not fully supported yet.
Do not use it or use it only at your own risk.
It is not included in any midPoint support agreement.

Native attribute with the name of 'id' cannot be currently used in midPoint (bug:MID-3872[]). If the attribute name in the resource cannot be changed then the workaround is to force the use of legacy schema.
In that case midPoint will use the legacy ConnId attribute names (icfs:name and icfs:uid).

JavaDoc is temporarily not available due to the https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8061305[issue in Java platform].
This issue is fixed in Java 9 platform, but backport of this fix to Java 8 is (quite surprisingly) not planned.
