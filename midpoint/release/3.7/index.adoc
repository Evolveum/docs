<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> (1809 - 1882) was English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for the theory of evolution.
    Darwin's famous book On the Origin of Species described theory of evolution, mechanism of natural selection that explains the diversity of life.
    His voyage on HMS Beagle established him as an eminent geologist and made him famous as a popular author.
    Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history.
</p>
<p>
    Darwin's theory of evolution is the unifying theory of the life sciences.
    The theory describes the process how species evolve and adapt over successive generations.
    MidPoint 3.7 is such an evolutionary step in midPoint development.
    This midPoint release brings gradual improvements in many diverse areas.
    Identity governance features are improved, both in capabilities of the engine and the user interface.
    MidPoint expressions have gained more power and ease of use. There are notable improvements in user interface, security, task management and many smaller improvements in various areas.
    The scope of almost the entire release was guided by midPoint subscribers and sponsors - which provided the perfect environment for this step in midPoint evolution.

=== Limitations

* MidPoint 3.7 comes with a bundled LDAP-based eDirectory connector.
This connector is stable, however it is not included in the normal midPoint support.
Support for this connector has to be purchased separately.

== Platforms

MidPoint is known to work well in the following deployment environment.
The following list is list of *tested* platforms, i.e. platforms that midPoint team or reliable partners personally tested with this release.
The version numbers in parentheses are the actual version numbers used for the tests.
However it is very likely that midPoint will also work in similar environments.
Also note that this list is not closed.
MidPoint can be supported in almost any reasonably recent platform (please contact Evolveum for more details).


=== Java

* OpenJDK 8 (1.8.0_91, 1.8.0_111, 1.8.0_151)

* Sun/Oracle Java SE Runtime Environment 8 (1.8.0_45, 1.8.0_65, 1.8.0_74, 1.8.0_131)


=== Web Containers

* Apache Tomcat 8 (8.0.14, 8.0.20, 8.0.28, 8.0.30, 8.0.33, 8.5.4)

* BEA/Oracle WebLogic (12c) -  special subscription required


[NOTE]
.Web container (application server) support
====
MidPoint 3.7 introduced xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/stand-alone-deployment/[Stand-alone deployment] form that does not need an application server.
This is the primary deployment model for midPoint.
The deployment to web container is still supported.
However the only supported web container is Apache Tomcat.
Other web containers (application servers) may be supported if the support is explicitly negotiated in midPoint subscription.
Except for those cases midPoint development team will not provide any support for other web containers.

Currently there are no plans to remove support for deployed midPoint installation using a WAR file.
However, it is possible that this deployment form will get phased out eventually unless there are active subscribers preferring this deployment method.
MidPoint subscription is strongly recommended if you plan to use this method in the future.
====


=== Databases

* H2 (embedded, only recommended for demo deployments)

* PostgreSQL (8.4.14, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.4.5, 9.5, 9.5.1) +
Support for PostgreSQL 8.4 is deprecated.
The support will be dropped in the future.

* MariaDB (10.0.28)

* MySQL (5.6.26, 5.7) +
Supported MySQL version is 5.6.10 and above (with MySQL JDBC ConnectorJ 5.1.23 and above). +
MySQL in previous versions didn't support dates/timestamps with more accurate than second fraction precision.

* Oracle 11g (11.2.0.2.0) +
Oracle 11g support is deprecated in midPoint 3.7. This will be replaced for Oracle 12c support in midPoint 3.8.

* Microsoft SQL Server (2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2014) +
Support for Microsoft SQL Server 2008 and 2008 R2 is deprecated.
The support will be dropped in the future.


=== Supported Browsers

* Firefox (any recent version)

* Safari (any recent version)

* Chrome (any recent version)

* Opera (any recent version)

* Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 9 or later)

Recent version of browser as mentioned above means any stable stock version of the browser released in the last two years.
We formally support only stock, non-customized versions of the browsers without any extensions or other add-ons.
According to the experience most extensions should work fine with midPoint.
However, it is not possible to test midPoint with all of them and support all of them.
Therefore, if you chose to use extensions or customize the browser in any non-standard way you are doing that on your own risk.
We reserve the right not to support customized web browsers.

Microsoft Internet Explorer compatibility mode is *not* supported.

[NOTE]
.Stand-alone deployment model
====
MidPoint 3.7 deployment method has changed.
xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/stand-alone-deployment/[Stand-alone deployment] is now the default deployment method.
MidPoint default configuration, scripts and almost everything else was adapted for this method.

* *New midPoint users* and *new deployments* should simply follow the wiki:Installing+midPoint+v3.7[installation manual].

* *Existing deployments* may keep using exactly the same configuration as before.
wiki:Deploying+MidPoint+as+Web+Application[Deployment of midPoint as Web Application] is still supported as an alternative.
However, xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/stand-alone-deployment/[stand-alone deployment] is now the primary option.
It is recommended to migrate the deployment based on application server to a stand-alone deployment in the future.
See our wiki:Migrating+from+Tomcat+to+Standalone+midPoint+Deployment[brief migration guide].
====

== Upgrade

MidPoint is software that is designed for easy upgradeability.
We do our best to maintain strong backward compatibility of midPoint data model, configuration and system behavior.
However, midPoint is also very flexible and comprehensive software system with a very rich data model.
It is not humanly possible to test all the potential upgrade paths and scenarios.
Also some changes in midPoint behavior are inevitable to maintain midPoint development pace.
Therefore we can assure reliable midPoint upgrades only for link:https://evolveum.com/services/[midPoint subscribers]. This section provides overall overview of the changes and upgrade procedures.
Although we try to our best it is not possible to foresee all possible uses of midPoint.
Therefore the information provided in this section are for information purposes only without any guarantees of completeness.
In case of any doubts about upgrade or behavior changes please use services associated with link:https://evolveum.com/services/[midPoint subscription] or purchase link:https://evolveum.com/services/professional-services/[professional services].


=== Upgrade from midPoint 3.0, 3.1, 3.1.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.3.1, 3.4, 3.4.1, 3.5 and 3.5.1

Upgrade path from MidPoint 3.0 goes through midPoint 3.1, 3.1.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4.1, 3.5.1 and 3.6.1. Upgrade to midPoint 3.1 first (refer to the xref:/midpoint/release/3.1/[midPoint 3.1 release notes]). Then upgrade from midPoint 3.1 to 3.1.1, from 3.1.1 to 3.2 then to 3.3, then to 3.4.1, 3.5.1, 3.6.1 and finally to 3.7.


=== Upgrade from midPoint 3.6 and 3.6.1

MidPoint 3.7 data model is essentially backwards compatible with both midPoint 3.6 and midPoint 3.6.1. However as the data model was extended in 3.7 the database schema needs to be upgraded using the xref:/midpoint/reference/upgrade/database-schema-upgrade/[usual mechanism]. There are a few points to highlight that are related to database structure upgrade:

* Besides midPoint own tables there are two simple changes in Quartz database structure as well. Migration is ensured using upgrade scripts in the /config/sql/_all/ directory (along with changes in midPoint own tables).

* The taskIdentifier item has now a uniqueness constraint: it is possible (although quite unlike) that database migration script would fail when it tries to introduce the constraint. In such cases it is necessary to delete conflicting tasks and then continue with updating the database.

MidPoint 3.7 is a release that fixes some issues of previous versions.
Therefore there are some changes that are not strictly backward compatible.

* Version numbers of some bundled connectors have changed.
Therefore connector references from the resource definitions that are using the bundled connectors need to be updated.

* MidPoint has switched to a xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/stand-alone-deployment/[stand-alone deployment] model.
MidPoint no longer requires explicit deployment to a web container.
The web container is bundled inside midPoint distribution.
This change is intended to make midPoint easier to deploy, use and maintain.
However, this change may affect existing deployment of midPoint.
Following is a summary of the most important changes: +


** As midPoint is stand-alone server now, it has its own run control (start/stop) scripts.
Those scripts are provided in the distribution package.

** Structure of the distribution package has changed to adapt to the stand-alone deployment model.

** The location of a default xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/midpoint-home-directory/[midPoint home directory] has changed.
The default is now `var` subdirectory of the installation directory.

** Default URL is changed.
The `midpoint` path prefix is dropped.
Therefore URL that used to be `http://host:8080/midpoint/self` is now just `http://host:8080/self`.

** Default logging setup now maintains log files in the `log` subdirectory of midPoint home directory.
The default log file was changed from `idm.log` to `midpoint.log`. However, please note that if you have existing logging configuration in wiki:System+Configuration+Object[system configuration object], that configuration will be still used after upgrade.
Upgrade process does not change that automatically.
It needs to be updated manually.



* The assignment.trigger item (of EvaluatedPolicyRuleTriggerType) is now deprecated and partially replaced by assignment.triggeredPolicyRule. Original assignment.trigger item was automatically computed and took a considerable amount of storage space. So, in 3.7, after each model operation on a focal object, the assignment.trigger is automatically erased. Therefore these values will be gradually removed. If you want to remove them at once, you can either execute e.g. recomputation of all affected objects or write a custom bulk action to remove the values.


=== Changes in initial objects since 3.6 and 3.6.1

MidPoint has a built-in set of "initial objects" that it will automatically create in the database if they are not present.
This includes vital objects for the system to be configured (e.g. role `superuser` and user `administrator`). These objects may change in some midPoint releases.
But to be conservative and to avoid configuration overwrite midPoint does not overwrite existing objects when they are already in the database.
This may result in upgrade problems if the existing object contains configuration that is no longer supported in a new version.
Therefore the following list contains a summary of changes to the initial objects in this midPoint release.
The complete new set of initial objects is in the `config/initial-objects` directory in both the source and binary distributions.
Although any problems caused by the change in initial objects is unlikely to occur, the implementors are advised to review the following list and assess the impact on case-by-case basis:* *

* 010-value-policy.xml: Removed deprecated lifetime section from initial password policy.

* 020-system-configuration.xml: Changed logging configuration to adapt to stand-alone deployment model (see above).

* 040-role-enduser.xml: Added authorization to read user to fully support deputy functionality.

* 110-report-user-list.xml: Fixed filter in user list report.

* 160-report-certification-decisions.xml: Several certification report improvements.

* 200-lookup-languages.xml: New languages.

* 210-lookup-locales.xml: New languages.


=== Bundled connector changes since 3.6 and 3.6.1

* The *LDAP connector* and *AD Connector* were upgraded to the latest available version.


=== Behavior changes since 3.6 and 3.6.1

* xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/stand-alone-deployment/[Stand-Alone Deployment] is now the default deployment model (see above).

* Spring resource bundle logger logs unsuccessful attempt to locate a resource bundle on warning level.
MidPoint tries to locate several resource bundles for extensibility and those bundles normally does not exist.
Therefore there may be a lot of warnings in the logs.
The workaround is to set the `org.springframework.context.support.ResourceBundleMessageSource` logger to error level.
This solution has been applied to midPoint initial objects.
However older midPoint deployment may need to set this logger manually.

* There were subtle fixes in the way how outbound mappings are processed.
Several issues that seem to be present in midPoint for quite some time were fixed.
Those mostly affect seldom used and corner cases.
For example if a value produced by mapping matched intolerant pattern such value was ignored in midPoint 3.6 and earlier.
The values is not correctly set to target.
Values dictated by removed assignment were removed, even if that assignment was invalid (e.g. disabled).
Those issues were fixed in midPoint 3.7. However, the deployments that relied on incorrect behavior might be affected during upgrade.

* MidPoint 3.7 improved behavior of inbound mappings.
Inbound mappings can be used to map resource attributes directly to assignments.
This change may influence some corner cases for inbound mappings, such as mapping tolerance.
MidPoint 3.7 improvements tried to maintain the prior behavior of inbound mapping tolerance.
However the behavior may be different is some corner cases.
Careful testing of inbound mappings with non-default tolerance is recommended.
Note: The schema documentation of midPoint 3.6.1 and earlier container wrong specification of mapping tolerance behavior.
MidPoint 3.6.1 and earlier was behaving in a way that was not consistent with documentation.
MidPoint 3.7 documentation was corrected to describe the implemented behavior.
However, the behavior of was *not* changed to maintain compatibility.

** Behavior of midPoint 3.6 was not correct when more than one inbound mapping produced a value for the same target single-value property.
MidPoint 3.6 processed such mappings without error, discarding one of the values.
MidPoint 3.7 will correctly raise an error in this situation.



* In approval-related expressions (e.g. stage auto-completion conditions), do not use midpoint.getChannel() to obtain the channel for the original request. It is not present when evaluating approval process preview (Evolveum Jirakey,summary,type,created,updated,due,assignee,reporter,priority,status,resolution701b45f2-090c-3276-8ac9-f45eedf731bcMID-4071). Use new channel variable instead.

* Default for task/executionConstraints/groupTaskLimit was changed from 1 to unlimited. Properties allowedNode and disallowedNode are now deprecated (and ignored with warning). They are replaced by node/taskExecutionLimitations item. See .

* If you want to use execution groups other than default (null), make sure their execution is allowed on individual nodes. Before 3.7 the default behavior was not limiting execution of tasks in these groups.

* Policy situations and triggers are not stored by default now. Use the record policy action for this.

* Predefined policy situation http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/model/policy/situation#assigned is no longer available. If you used it in situation constraints, replace it by http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/model/policy/situation#modified. But note that the new situation is triggered for both assignments and objects; therefore if you need to specify rules for assignments only please use evaluationTarget of assignment.

* There are new wiki:Authorization+Configuration[authorizations] for raw operations and partial execution operations.
Raw operations are used for example to edit objects in GUI "repository objects" page.
Those operations did not require any extra authorizations in midPoint 3.6.1 and earlier.
Starting with midPoint 3.7 extra authorizations are required in addition to normal object access authorizations (read, add, modify, delete).

* MidPoint 3.7 structure is based on Spring Boot.
The old XML-based spring configuration has been phased out and replaced with annotation-based configuration.
There were (officially unsupported) Spring Security authentication modules for LDAP and CAS.
The LDAP module configuration was migrated to annotation-based configuration and it is now accessible by activating appropriate spring profile.
However, the CAS configuration was not migrated and there are no specific plans for this migration to happen.
The migration needs to be requested by midPoint subscriber.
We will also gladly accept the migration as a community contribution.

* MidPoint 3.6.1 and earlier included a `repo-ninja` tool for emergency operations over midPoint repository.
That tool was replaced with next-generation version of the tool called just `ninja`. Development of this new tool is still work in progress, however, it is capable of an equivalent emergency operations as the old tool.
Brief documentation is available at xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/ninja/[Ninja] page.


=== Public interface changes since 3.6 and 3.6.1

* The `thisObject` variable is deprecated.
The variable was too simplistic for use in complex use cases.
Now the entire wiki:Using+Assignment+Path+in+Expressions[assignment path] is exposed for use in the expressions.
It is recommended to use assignment path instead of `thisObject` variable.

* Changes in local Java interfaces +


** User-friendy (localizable) messages in exceptions

** New midPoint functions

** Changes to the Model API related to evaluated assignments and other parts of model context.

** Changes in Prism

** Audit record changes




=== Important internal changes since 3.6 and 3.6.1

These changes should not influence people that use midPoint "as is".
These changes should also not influence the XML/JSON/YAML-based customizations or scripting expressions that rely just on the provided library classes.
These changes will influence midPoint forks and deployments that are heavily customized using the Java components.

* Security component structure has been redesigned.

* Many internal components were refactored, restructured and cleaned up.
This may have severe impact on midPoint customizations that go beyond public interfaces, but it should not affect public interfaces.
Therefore moderate customizations should be unaffected.

* `MappingType` data type has been changed from property to container.
Code that is changing mappings (e.g. deltas) needs to be updates.

There is a support to set up storage of credentials in either encrypted or hashed form.
There is also unsupported and undocumented option to turn off credential storage.
This option partially works, but there may be side effects and interactions.
This option is not fully supported yet.
Do not use it or use it only at your own risk.
It is not included in any midPoint support agreement.

Native attribute with the name of 'id' cannot be currently used in midPoint (bug:MID-3872[]). If the attribute name in the resource cannot be changed then the workaround is to force the use of legacy schema.
In that case midPoint will use the legacy ConnId attribute names (icfs:name and icfs:uid).

JavaDoc is temporarily not available due to the link:https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8061305[issue in Java platform]. This issue is fixed in Java 9 platform, but backport of this fix to Java 8 is (quite surprisingly) not planned.
