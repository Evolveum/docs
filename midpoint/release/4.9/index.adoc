=== Limitations

Following list provides summary of limitation of this midPoint release.

* Functionality that is marked as xref:/midpoint/versioning/experimental/[Experimental Functionality] is not supported for general use (yet).
Such features are not covered by midPoint support.
They are supported only for those subscribers that funded the development of this feature by the means of
xref:/support/subscription-sponsoring/[subscriptions and sponsoring] or for those that explicitly negotiated such support in their support contracts.

* MidPoint comes with bundled xref:/connectors/connectors/com.evolveum.polygon.connector.ldap.LdapConnector/[LDAP Connector].
Support for LDAP connector is included in standard midPoint support service, but there are limitations.
This "bundled" support only includes operations of LDAP connector that 100% compliant with LDAP standards.
Any non-standard functionality is explicitly excluded from the bundled support.
We strongly recommend to explicitly negotiate support for a specific LDAP server in your midPoint support contract.
Otherwise, only standard LDAP functionality is covered by the support.
See xref:/connectors/connectors/com.evolveum.polygon.connector.ldap.LdapConnector/[LDAP Connector] page for more details.

* MidPoint comes with bundled xref:/connectors/connectors/com.evolveum.polygon.connector.ldap.ad.AdLdapConnector/[Active Directory Connector (LDAP)].
Support for AD connector is included in standard midPoint support service, but there are limitations.
Only some versions of Active Directory deployments are supported.
Basic AD operations are supported, but advanced operations may not be supported at all.
The connector does not claim to be feature-complete.
See xref:/connectors/connectors/com.evolveum.polygon.connector.ldap.ad.AdLdapConnector/[Active Directory Connector (LDAP)] page for more details.

* MidPoint user interface has flexible (responsive) design, it is able to adapt to various screen sizes, including screen sizes used by some mobile devices.
However, midPoint administration interface is also quite complex, and it would be very difficult to correctly support all midPoint functionality on very small screens.
Therefore, midPoint often works well on larger mobile devices (tablets), but it is very likely to be problematic on small screens (mobile phones).
Even though midPoint may work well on mobile devices, the support for small screens is not included in standard midPoint subscription.
Partial support for small screens (e.g. only for self-service purposes) may be provided, but it has to be explicitly negotiated in a subscription contract.

* There are several add-ons and extensions for midPoint that are not explicitly distributed with midPoint.
This includes xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/midpoint-client-java/[Java client library],
various https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples[samples], scripts, connectors and other non-bundled items.
Support for these non-bundled items is limited.
Generally speaking, those non-bundled items are supported only for platform subscribers and those that explicitly negotiated the support in their contract.

* MidPoint contains a basic case management user interface.
This part of midPoint user interface is not finished.
The only supported parts of this user interface are those that are used to process requests, approvals, and manual correlation.
Other parts of case management user interface are considered to be experimental, especially the parts dealing with manual provisioning cases.

This list is just an overview, it may not be complete.
Please see the documentation regarding detailed limitations of individual features.

== Platforms

MidPoint is known to work well in the following deployment environment.
The following list is list of *tested* platforms, i.e. platforms that midPoint team or reliable partners personally tested with this release.
The version numbers in parentheses are the actual version numbers used for the tests.

It is very likely that midPoint will also work in similar environments.
But only the versions specified below are supported as part of midPoint subscription and support programs - unless a different version is explicitly agreed in the contract.

=== Operating System

MidPoint is likely to work on any operating system that supports the Java platform.
However, for *production deployment*, only some operating systems are supported:

* Linux (x86_64)
* Windows Server (2022)

We are positive that midPoint can be successfully installed on other operating systems, especially macOS and Microsoft Windows desktop.
Such installations can be used to for evaluation, demonstration or development purposes.
However, we do not support these operating systems for production environments.
The tooling for production use is not maintained, such as various run control (start/stop) scripts, low-level administration and migration tools, backup and recovery support and so on.
Please see xref:/midpoint/install/bare-installation/platform-support/[] for details.

Note that production deployments in Windows environments are supported only for LTS releases.

=== Java

Following Java platform versions are supported:

* Java 21.
This is a *recommended* platform.

* Java 17.

OpenJDK 21 is the recommended Java platform to run midPoint.

Support for Oracle builds of JDK is provided only for the period in which Oracle provides public support (free updates) for their builds.

MidPoint is an open source project, and as such it relies on open source components.
We cannot provide support for platform that do not have public updates as we would not have access to those updates, and therefore we cannot reproduce and fix issues.
Use of open source OpenJDK builds with public support is recommended instead of proprietary builds.

=== Databases

Since midPoint 4.4, midPoint comes with two repository implementations: _native_ and _generic_.
Native PostgreSQL repository implementation is strongly recommended for all production deployments.

See xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/repository-database-support/[] for more details.

Since midPoint 4.0, *PostgreSQL is the recommended database* for midPoint deployments.
Our strategy is to officially support the latest stable version of PostgreSQL database (to the practically possible extent).
PostgreSQL database is the only database with clear long-term support plan in midPoint.
We make no commitments for future support of any other database engines.
See xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/repository-database-support/[] page for the details.
Only a direct connection from midPoint to the database engine is supported.
Database and/or SQL proxies, database load balancers or any other devices (e.g. firewalls) that alter the communication are not supported.

==== Native Database Support

xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/native-postgresql/[Native PostgreSQL repository implementation] is developed and tuned
specially for PostgreSQL database, taking advantage of native database features, providing improved performance and scalability.

This is now the *primary and recommended repository* for midPoint deployments.
Following database engines are supported:

* PostgreSQL 16, 15, 14

PostgreSQL 16 is recommended.

==== Generic Database Support (deprecated)

xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/generic/[Generic repository implementation] is based on object-relational
mapping abstraction (Hibernate), supporting several database engines with the same code.
Following database engines are supported with this implementation:

* H2 (embedded).
Supported only in embedded mode.
Not supported for production deployments.
Only the version specifically bundled with midPoint is supported. +
H2 is intended only for development, demo and similar use cases.
It is *not* supported for any production use.
Also, upgrade of deployments based on H2 database are not supported.

* Oracle 21c
* Microsoft SQL Server 2019

Support for xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/generic/[generic repository implementation] together with all the database engines supported by this implementation is *deprecated*.
It is *strongly recommended* to migrate to xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/native-postgresql/[native PostgreSQL repository implementation] as soon as possible.
See xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/repository-database-support/[] for more details.

=== Supported Browsers

* Firefox
* Safari
* Chrome
* Edge
* Opera

Any recent version of the browsers is supported.
That means any stable stock version of the browser released in the last two years.
We formally support only stock, non-customized versions of the browsers without any extensions or other add-ons.
According to the experience most extensions should work fine with midPoint.
However, it is not possible to test midPoint with all of them and support all of them.
Therefore, if you chose to use extensions or customize the browser in any non-standard way you are doing that on your own risk.
We reserve the right not to support customized web browsers.

== Upgrade

MidPoint is a software designed with easy upgradeability in mind.
We do our best to maintain strong backward compatibility of midPoint data model, configuration and system behavior.
However, midPoint is also very flexible and comprehensive software system with a very rich data model.
It is not humanly possible to test all the potential upgrade paths and scenarios.
Also, some changes in midPoint behavior are inevitable to maintain midPoint development pace.
Therefore, there may be some manual actions and configuration changes that need to be done during upgrades,
mostly related to xref:/midpoint/versioning/feature-lifecycle/[feature lifecycle].

This section provides overall overview of the changes and upgrade procedures.
Although we try to our best, it is not possible to foresee all possible uses of midPoint.
Therefore, the information provided in this section are for information purposes only without any guarantees of completeness.
In case of any doubts about upgrade or behavior changes please use services associated with xref:/support/subscription-sponsoring/[midPoint subscription programs].

Please refer to the xref:/midpoint/reference/upgrade/upgrade-guide/[] for general instructions and description of the upgrade process.
The guide describes the steps applicable for upgrades of all midPoint releases.
Following sections provide details regarding release {release-version}.

=== Upgrade From MidPoint 4.8x

MidPoint {release-version} data model is backwards compatible with previous midPoint version.
Please follow our xref:/midpoint/reference/upgrade/upgrade-guide/[Upgrade guide] carefully.

[IMPORTANT]
Be sure to be on the latest version for 4.8, otherwise you will
not be warned about all the necessary schema changes and other possible incompatibilities.

Note that:

* There are database schema changes (see xref:/midpoint/reference/upgrade/database-schema-upgrade/[Database schema upgrade]).

* Version numbers of some bundled connectors have changed.
Connector references from the resource definitions that are using the bundled connectors need to be updated.

* See also the _Actions required_ information below.

It is strongly recommended migrating to the xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/native-postgresql/[new native PostgreSQL repository implementation]
for all deployments that have not migrated yet.
However, it is *not* recommended upgrading the system and migrating the repositories in one step.
It is recommended doing it in two separate steps.
Please see xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/native-postgresql/migration/[] for the details.

=== Upgrade From MidPoint 4.4.x LTS

Both midPoint 4.4 and midPoint 4.8 are xref:/support/long-term-support/[long-term support (LTS)] releases.
Therefore, there is a direct upgrade path from midPoint 4.4 to midPoint 4.8.
Please follow our
xref:/midpoint/reference/upgrade/upgrade-guide/[upgrade guide] carefully.

[IMPORTANT]
*Be sure to be on the latest maintenance version for 4.4 LTS*, at least version 4.4.6, otherwise you will
not be warned about all the necessary schema changes and other possible incompatibilities.

Upgrade of midPoint 4.4 to midPoint 4.8 is effectively upgrade of four midPoint versions in one step.
Although the upgrade scripts and instructions will do the "technical" part of the upgrade, updating the database schema and the software in a single step,
there still may be functionality changes in all the intermediary midPoint releases.
Therefore, it is *strongly recommended reading all the release notes for all the intermediary releases* (4.5, 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8), adjusting your configuration as necessary.

The most important changes are summarized in xref:#_changes_with_respect_to_version_4_4[Changes With Respect to Version 4.4] section.

Please see also xrefv:/midpoint/reference/support-4.8/upgrade/faq-issues/[Frequently asked questions for upgrade].

=== Upgrade From Other MidPoint Versions

Upgrade from midPoint versions other than 4.4.x or 4.8.x to midPoint {release-version} is not supported directly.
Please upgrade to one of these versions (at least 4.4.6 or 4.8.1) first.

=== Deprecation, Feature Removal And Major Incompatible Changes Since 4.8

NOTE: This section is relevant to the majority of midPoint deployments.
It refers to the most significant functionality removals and changes in this version.

[#_behavior_changes_since_4_8]
=== Behavior Changes Since 4.8

[NOTE]
====
This section describes changes in the behavior that existed before this release.
New behavior is not mentioned here.
Plain bugfixes (correcting incorrect behavior) are skipped too.
Only things that cannot be described as simple "fixing" something are described here.

The changes since 4.8 are of interest probably for "advanced" midPoint deployments only.
You should at least scan through them, though.
====

* TODO

=== Java and REST API Changes Since 4.8

NOTE: As for the Java API, this section describes changes in `midpoint` and `basic` function libraries.
(MidPoint does not have explicitly defined Java API, yet.
But these two objects are something that can be unofficially considered to be the API of midPoint, usable e.g. from scripts.)

* TODO

=== Internal Changes Since 4.8

NOTE: These changes should not influence people that use midPoint "as is".
They should also not influence the XML/JSON/YAML-based customizations or scripting expressions that rely just on the provided library classes.
These changes will influence midPoint forks and deployments that are heavily customized using the Java components.

* TODO
