*Date:* 

*Severity:* High (CVSS 8.0)

*Affected versions:* all midPoint versions

*Fixed in versions:* 4.4.6, 4.8, 4.7.2


== Description

Non-admin users which are authorized to execute bulk actions (using `model-3#executeScript` authorization) are able to execute arbitrary Groovy code, if they have authorization to submit custom bulk actions using rest (authorization `rest#all`) or have access to Bulk Actions page (authorization `ui-3#pageBulkAction`).

NOTE: Authorization `model-3#executeScript` sounds like it should allow Groovy script execution, but was intended only to enable access to bulk actions.


== Severity and Impact

This is high-severity issue.

The affected feature is not enabled by default to end-users. MidPoint deployment is only affected if non-administrator users have authorization for: `#executeScript` and  `rest#all` or `#executeScript` and `ui-3#pageBulkAction`.


== Mitigation

* Update to latest maintenance midPoint release which contains fix.
* Remove authorizations for `rest#all` or `ui-3#pageBulkAction` for those users, which have `model-3#executeScript` authorization.
