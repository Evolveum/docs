:page-display-order: 20
:page-upkeep-status: green

*Date:* 20. 9. 2023

*Severity:* High (CVSS 8.0)

*Affected versions:* All midPoint versions prior to 4.4.6, 4.7.2, 4.8

*Fixed in versions:* 4.8, 4.7.2, 4.4.6


== Description

CSRF vulnerability exists if midPoint is configured to use remote authentication using *SAML 2* or *OIDC* and user was authorized using these providers. Users authenticated using built-in login form are not affected.

== Severity and Impact

This is High Severity Issue

Normal built-in midPoint login is not affected, but 
it is possible to construct CSRF attack for logged-in user if remote authentication via *SAML 2* or *OIDC* was used to log in.

== Mitigation

Users of affected MidPoint versions are advised to upgrade their deployments to the latest maintenance release.

== Discussion and Explanation

During remote authentication sequence token-based CSRF protection (provided by Spring Framework) needs to be disabled for session, but the issue was that it was not automatically re-enabled once authentication was completed. The fixed code contains improved conditions and token based CSRF is enforced once remote authentication is completed.
