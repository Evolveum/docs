== OWASP Dependency-Track

MidPoint builds are periodically scanned by https://dependencytrack.org/[Dependency-Track] tool to detect known common vulnerabilities in dependencies of midPoint and build-in connectors.

Not all common vulnerabilities reported by dependency scan are exploitable vulnerabilities.
Some findings may be false positives - mdPoint does not use vulnerable dependencies in a deployment or in a way described in vulnerability.

Should you be interested in the scanning results, let us know at security@evolveum.com and we will provide you with the latest report.
