== Build

There are three types of Studio builds:

|====
| Build type | Quality | Description

| stable
| production
| Production-quality official releases.

| milestone
| beta
| Intended for testing, evaluation of new features, gathering of community feedback and so on.

| nightly
| varies, no guarantees
| Development happens here.
Latest functionality, but the code may break any time.
Use at your own risk.
|====


== Adding Plugin Repository

Custom repository needs to be added to use nightly or milestone builds:

. Go to menu `File` → `Settings (Preferences)` → `Plugins` → `Manage plugin repositories`

. Add repository:

** `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/Nightly/list` for nightly builds
** `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/Milestone/list` for milestones

. Search for `MidPoint Studio` and click on `Install`

== Release

=== Steps

. update `studio-idea-plugin/src/main/resources/META-INF/plugin.xml`
.. edit `description` if needed
.. update `change-notes`, add release description
. make sure `studio-idea-plugin/build.gradle` contains proper since/until build compatiblity values
. align git branches nightly -> milestone -> stable
.. all branches up to *released* one shouldn't contain any differences
. in project run `./gradlew clean buildPlugin runPluginVerifier`
.. check validation results in `studio-idea-plugin/build/reports/pluginVerifier/*/report.html`
. execute jenkins job `midpoint-studio-release` with `PUBLISH=true` and proper release branch
.. jenkins will create and publish all necessary branches up to *released* one
.. go to `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13809-midpoint-studio/versions`
* validate published plugins/versions
.. go to `https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-studio/releases`
* validate created git tags for each published build
.. notifications from Jetbrains Marketplace will be send after:
... plugin was uploaded
... plugin compatibility was checked
... plugin was approved
. on `master` branch update plugin version in `build.gradle` and change notes in `plugin.xml`

=== Issues

. in case build wasn't correct but plugin was published to JetBrains Marketplace
.. go to `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13809-midpoint-studio/versions`
.. find plugin version you want to hide/delete and click `Hide update` or `Remove update` icon
