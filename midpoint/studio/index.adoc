= MidPoint Studio

MidPoint studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) to develop solutions based on midPoint.
The primary purpose of MidPoint Studio is to support process of creating, developing and maintaining midPoint configurations.
However, there may be other advanced features in the futures, such as visualizations, configuration wizards and so on.
The Studio is developed in the same iterative way as midPoint.
It will be improved and extended as needed (and as the funding allows).

MidPoint Studio is built on top of open source https://www.jetbrains.com/opensource/idea/[IntelliJ platform] that is the foundation of IntelliJ IDEA, a well-known IDE for Java developers.
While https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA] has a commercial  _Ultimate Edition_ (which we recommend), there is also an open source _Community Edition_ of the IDE, that is built on an open source platform.
MidPoint Studio is a plug-in for IntelliJ platform that will work both in the _Community_ and _Ultimate_ editions of IntelliJ IDEA.

== Compatibility, Versioning and Releases

Studio is using the same versioning scheme as midPoint.
Therefore, compatible version of Studio will have the same version as midPoint.
Interim (milestone) releases of the Studio have a build number added to the version number after the dash.

// TODO: add link to IntelliJ Marketplace when the milestone is released
|====
| Version | Release date | Release type | Description

| https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13809-midpoint-studio/versions/milestone/101871[4.2-150]
|10 Nov 2020
|Beta
|Initial release.
Beta quality.
Released in order to gather community feedback.

|====

It is quite likely newer Studio can be used to configure older midPoint releases, but there may be problems in case there are incompatible schema changes.
This usually happens when major version of midPoint is released, therefore using Studio within the constraints of major midPoint releases should work well.
However, this is all just "best effort" compatibility.
Strict schema compatibility is not officially supported yet.
It probably will not be supported until midPoint makes a complete switch to Axiom.
When Studio does not work for older versions, use the matching version of Studio instead.

== Community and Feedback

link:/community/mailing-lists/[MidPoint mailing lists] can be used to discuss the Studio and provide community feedback.
The usual https://wiki.evolveum.com/display/midPoint/Creating+a+Bug+Report[bug reporting procedure] should be used to report studio issue.
Please make sure to set the component field to `Studio` and include studio version number in the report.
