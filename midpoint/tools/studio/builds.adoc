== Adding Plugin Repository

Custom repository needs to be added to use snapshot builds:

. Go to menu `File` → `Settings (Preferences)` → `Plugins` → `Manage plugin repositories`

. Add repository:

** `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/Snapshot/list` for snapshot builds

. Search for `MidPoint Studio` and click on `Install`

== Migrating from nightly/milestone plugin repository to snapshot repository

. Go to menu `File` -> `Settings (Preferences)` → `Plugins`
.. Uninstall MidPoint Studio plugin
. Go to menu `File` → `Settings (Preferences)` → `Plugins` → `Manage plugin repositories`
.. Edit existing url of nightly/milestone repository, change it to `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/Snapshot/list`
. Search for `MidPoint Studio` and click on `Install`

== Release Procedure

. update `studio-idea-plugin/src/main/resources/META-INF/plugin.xml`
.. edit `description` if needed
.. update `change-notes`, add release description
. make sure `studio-idea-plugin/build.gradle` contains proper since/until build compatiblity values
. align git branches snapshot -> stable
.. all branches up to *released* one shouldn't contain any differences
. in project run `./gradlew clean buildPlugin runPluginVerifier`
.. check validation results in `studio-idea-plugin/build/reports/pluginVerifier/*/report.html`
. execute jenkins job `midpoint-studio-release` with `PUBLISH=true` and proper release branch
.. jenkins will create and publish all necessary branches up to *released* one
.. go to `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13809-midpoint-studio/versions`
* validate published plugins/versions
.. go to `https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-studio/releases`
* validate created git tags for each published build
.. notifications from Jetbrains Marketplace will be sent after:
... plugin was uploaded
... plugin compatibility was checked
... plugin was approved
. on `master` branch update plugin version in `build.gradle` and change notes in `plugin.xml`

=== Issues
