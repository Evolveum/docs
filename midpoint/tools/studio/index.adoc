MidPoint studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) to develop solutions based on midPoint.
The primary purpose of MidPoint Studio is to support process of creating, developing and maintaining midPoint configurations.
However, there may be other advanced features in the future, such as visualizations, configuration wizards and so on.
The Studio is developed in the same iterative way as midPoint.
It will be improved and extended as needed (and as the funding allows).

MidPoint Studio is built on top of open source https://www.jetbrains.com/opensource/idea/[IntelliJ platform] that is the foundation of IntelliJ IDEA, a well-known IDE for Java developers.
While https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA] has a commercial  _Ultimate Edition_ (which we recommend), there is also an open source _Community Edition_ of the IDE, that is built on an open source platform.
MidPoint Studio is a plug-in for IntelliJ platform that will work both in the _Community_ and _Ultimate_ editions of IntelliJ IDEA.

== Getting MidPoint Studio

MidPoint studio is distributed as IntelliJ IDEA plugin on https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13809-midpoint-studio[JetBrains marketplace].

Only a milestone (beta quality) release is available now.

. Download and install https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA].
Both _Community_ and _Ultimate_ editions will work.

. Start IntelliJ IDEA

If this is your very first start of IDEA:

. In the `Welcome to IntelliJ IDEA` window, go to `Plugins`

. Search for `MidPoint Studio` and click on `Install`
* If you like to live on the edge, you can try link:builds[snapshot builds] of Studio instead. Please read link:builds#adding-plugin-repository[Adding Plugin Repository chapter].

. IDEA will ask you for IDE restart

After IDE restart, you are ready to create a new project or open an existing one directly from the `Welcome to IntelliJ IDEA` window.


If you have already used IDEA before:

. Go to menu `File` → `Settings (Preferences)` → `Plugins`

. Search for `MidPoint Studio` and click on `Install`
* If you like to live on the edge, you can try link:builds[snapshot builds] of Studio instead. Please read link:builds#adding-plugin-repository[Adding Plugin Repository chapter].

. IDEA will ask you for IDE restart

After IDE restart, you are ready to create a new project or open an existing one.

If you use Microsoft Windows, you might need to add the `file.encoding` JVM property:

. Go to menu `Help` → `Edit Custom VM Options`
. Custom VM Options file will be opened
. Add the following ad the end of the file
+
[source,bash]
----
-Dfile.encoding=utf-8

|====

It is quite likely newer Studio can be used to configure older midPoint releases, but there may be problems in case there are incompatible schema changes.
This usually happens when major version of midPoint is released, therefore using Studio within the constraints of major midPoint releases should work well.
However, this is all just "best effort" compatibility.
Strict schema compatibility is not officially supported yet.
It probably will not be supported until midPoint makes a complete switch to Axiom.
When Studio does not work for older versions, use the matching version of Studio instead.

== Community and Feedback

xref:/community/mailing-lists/[MidPoint mailing lists] can be used to discuss the Studio and provide community feedback.
The usual xref:/midpoint/reference/diag/creating-a-bug-report/[bug reporting procedure] should be used to report studio issue.
Please make sure to set the component field to `Studio` and include studio version number in the report.
