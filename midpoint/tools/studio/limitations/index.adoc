* `Reviewed, not used` Actions
** File for action 1,2,3


== Resolved

* bug:MID-3386[] XML diff, compare remote with local.
* bug:MID-6538[] Resource connectorConfiguration element autocompletion/hints/documentaion.
* bug:MID-6755[] UTF8/Windows1250 encoding issue on windows. This is an issue in midpoint infra libraries, they assume UTF8 everywhere. Intellij Idea on windows by default sets `-Dfile.encoding=windows-1250`. Workaround mentioned in https://docs.evolveum.com/midpoint/studio/[docs].
* bug:MID-6728[] Direct bulk action execution. Bulk action can still be executed when wrapped as task
