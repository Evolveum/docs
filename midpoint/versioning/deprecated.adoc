Functionality marked as "deprecated" will be usually supported during support lifetime of the release in which it was deprecated.
Deprecated functionality may be removed in any subsequent release.
This will be usually a next minor or major release.
However, in serious cases support for deprecated functionality may be removed even in maintenance releases.
Such cases include removal of support for insecure or obsolete platforms, especially platforms that no longer have public security updates.
Functionality that is not covered by any midPoint subscription may also be removed in a maintenance release.
