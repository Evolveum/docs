Let's make this test case more interesting.
Following examples should be squashed together:

[source,xml]
----
<root>
    <of>
        <all>
            Evil
        </all>
    </of>
</root>
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "uglymus" : "maximus"
}
----

[source,yaml]
----
indent:
  ad:
    nauseam:
----

Examples below should be sqashed, yet the ordering is different.


[source,json]
----
{
  "axiom" : "rescues"
}
----

[source,xml]
----
<old>
    <dogs>
        <like>
            <it>anyway</it>
        </like>
    </dogs>
</old>
----


[source,yaml]
----
maybe:
  some: day
----

Just two languages below:

Examples below should be sqashed, yet the ordering is different.


[source,json]
----
{
  "axiom" : "rescues"
}
----

[source,xml]
----
<old>
    <dogs>
        <like>
            <it>anyway</it>
        </like>
    </dogs>
</old>
----

Unexpected language below. What do we want to do with it?


[source,json]
----
{
  "axiom" : "rescues"
}
----

[source,xml]
----
<old>
    <dogs>
        <like>
            <it>anyway</it>
        </like>
    </dogs>
</old>
----


[source,yaml]
----
maybe:
  some: day
----

[source,bash]
----
ninja --bushido atari
----

Examples below are all in XML. They should *not* be squashed:

[source,xml]
----
<lots>
    <of>
        <angle>
            <brackets/>
        </all>
    </of>
</lots>
----

[source,xml]
----
<minimalism/>
----

There is just one JSON example below. We want to keep that one as it is, no tabs, no squashing.

[source,json]
----
{
  "maybe" : "ugly",
  "but" : "it is everywhere"
}
----
